<p>Bob is flying to Monterey but must change course to avoid a storm. He flies \(19\degree\) off from his original direction until he clears the storm, then turns again to return back to his original flight path, intercepting it at an angle of \(54.9\degree\) and at a distance of 50 miles from where he had left it. How much farther did his detour require compared with his original course?</p>
