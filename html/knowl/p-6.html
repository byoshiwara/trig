<p>The ability to model problems or phenomena by algebraic expressions and equations is the ultimate goal of any algebra course. Through a variety of applications, we motivate students to develop the skills and techniques of algebra. Each chapter includes an interactive Investigation that gives students an opportunity to explore an openended modeling problem. These Investigations can be used in class as guided explorations or as projects for small groups. They are designed to show students how the mathematical techniques they are learning can be applied to study and understand new situations.</p>
