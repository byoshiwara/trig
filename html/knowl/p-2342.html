<p>Astronomers use a numerical scale called <em class="terminology">magnitude</em> to measure the brightness of a star, with brighter stars assigned smaller magnitudes. When we view a star from Earth, dust in the air absorbs some of the light, making the star appear fainter than it really is. Thus, the observed magnitude of a star, \(m\text{,}\) depends on the distance its light rays must travel through the Earth's atmosphere. The observed magnitude is given by</p>
\begin{equation*}
m = m_0 + kx
\end{equation*}
<p>where \(m_0\) is the actual magnitude of the star outside the atmosphere, \(x\) is the air mass (a measure of the distance through the atmosphere), and \(k\) is a constant called the <em class="terminology">extinction coefficient</em>. To calculate \(m_0\text{,}\) astronomers observe the same object several times during the night at different positions in the sky, and hence for different values of \(x\text{.}\) Here are data from such observations.
