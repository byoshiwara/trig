<li>Expressions containing trig ratios can be simplified or evaluated like other algebraic expressions. To simplify an expression containing trig ratios, we treat each ratio as a single variable.</li>
<li>The parentheses in an expression such as \(\sin (X + Y)\) indicate function notation, not multiplication.</li>
<li>We write \(\cos^2 \theta\) to denote \((\cos \theta)^2\text{,}\) and  \(\cos^n \theta\) to denote \((\cos \theta)^n\text{.}\)  (Similarly for the other trig ratios.)</li>
<li>An <dfn class="terminology">equation</dfn> is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal.  It may be true or false.</li>
<li>We can solve equations by trial and error, by using graphs, or by algebraic techniques.</li>
<li>To solve a trigonometric equation, we first isolate the trigonometric ratio on one side of the equation. We then use reference angles to find all the solutions between \(0\degree\) and \(360\degree\text{.}\)</li>
<li>An equation that is true only for certain values of the variable, and false for others, is called a <dfn class="terminology">conditional equation</dfn>. An equation that is true for all legitimate values of the variables is called an <dfn class="terminology">identity</dfn>.</li>
<li>The expressions on either side of the equal sign in an identity are called <dfn class="terminology">equivalent expressions</dfn>, because they have the same value for all values of the variable.</li>
<li>We often use identities to replace one form of an expression by a more useful form.</li>
<li>To check to whether an equation is an identity we can compare graphs of \(Y_1 = \) (left side of the equation) and \(Y_2 = \) (right side of the equation). If the two graphs agree, the equation is an identity.  If the two graphs are not the same, the equation is not an identity.</li>

<li>To solve an equation involving more than one trig function, we use identities to rewrite the equation in terms of a single trig function.</li>
<li>To prove an identity, we write one side of the equation in equivalent forms until it is identical to the other side of the equation.</li>
