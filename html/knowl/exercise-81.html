<p>If you have a baseball cap, here is another way to measure the distance across a river.  Stand at point \(A\) directly across the river from a convenient landmark, say a large rock, on the other side.  Tilt your head down so that the brim of the cap points directly at the base of the rock, \(R\text{.}\)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Draw a figure showing the river, the rock, and right triangle \(ABR\text{,}\) where \(B\) is the location of your baseball cap on your head.</li>
<li>Now, without changing the angle of your head, rotate \(90\degree\) and sight along the bank on your side of the river.  Have a friend mark the spot \(C\) on the ground where the brim of your cap points.  Add triangle \(ABC\) to your figure.</li>
<li>Finally, you can measure the distance from point \(A\) to point \(C\text{.}\)  Explain why this distance is the same as the distance across the river.</li>
