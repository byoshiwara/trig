<p>In this problem, we calculate the amount of energy generated by a cyclist. An athlete uses oxygen slowly when resting but more quickly during physical exertion. In an experiment, several trained cyclists took turns pedaling on a bicycle ergometer, which measures their work rate. The table shows the work rate of the cyclists, in watts, measured against their oxygen intake, in liters per minute. (Source: Pugh, 1974)</p>
