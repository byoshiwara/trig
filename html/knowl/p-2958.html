<p>We find the <em class="terminology">average</em>, or <em class="terminology">mean</em>, of a set of values by adding up the values and dividing the sum by the number of values. Thus, the average, \(\overline{x}\text{,}\) of the numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n\) is given by</p>
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ·· ·+x_n}{n}
\end{equation*}
<p>In a <em class="terminology">weighted average</em>, the numbers being averaged occur with different frequencies or are weighted differently in their contribution to the average value. For instance, suppose a biology class of 12 students takes a 10-point quiz. Of the 12 students, 2 receive 10s, three receive 9s, 5 receive 8s, and 2 receive scores of 6. The average score earned on the quiz is then</p>
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} = \frac{\alert{2}(10) + \alert{3}(9) + \alert{5}(8) + \alert{2}(6)}{12}=8.25
\end{equation*}
<p>The numbers in color are called the weights—in this example they represent the number of times each score was counted. Note that \(n\text{,}\) the total number of scores, is equal to the sum of the weights:</p>
\begin{equation*}
12 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 2
\end{equation*}
