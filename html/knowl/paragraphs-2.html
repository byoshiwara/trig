<article class="paragraphs"><p>Imagine a circle of radius 1unit rolling along a straight line. The circumference of a circle is \(2\pi\) times the length of its radius, so when the circle has turned through one complete revolution, it has traveled a distance of \(2\pi\) units.  When the circle has turned through half a revolution, it has taveled a distance of \(\pi\) units.</p>
<p>In radian measure, the angle through which the circle has turned is equal to the distance the circle has traveled, or the length of the arc that has unrolled on the line.</p>
<p>The idea of radian measure was developed by Roger Cotes, an English mathematician who worked closely with Isaac Newton.  He described the radian in everything but name, and recognized its naturalness as a unit of angular measure.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap6.html#paragraphs-2">in-context</a></span>
