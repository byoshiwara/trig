<article class="paragraphs"><p>The Babylonians lived between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present day Turkey and Syria.  They kept written records using a stylus to press cuneiform, or wedge-shaped, symbols into wet clay tablets, which were then baked in the sun. Thousands of these tablets have survived and give us detailed information about the mathematical practices of the time.</p>
<p>The Babylonians used a base 60 number system because the number 60 has many factors. They did not invent decimal fractions, so they found it difficult to deal with remainders when doing division.  But 60 can be divided evenly by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which made calculations with common fractions much easier.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="chap6.html#paragraphs-1">in-context</a></span>
