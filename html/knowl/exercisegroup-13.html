<p>A communications satellite is in a low earth orbit (LOE) at an altitude of 400 km. From the satellite, the angle of depression to earth's horizon is \(19.728\degree\text{.}\) Use this information to calculate the radius of the earth.</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">46</span></h5>
<p>The first Ferris wheel was built for the 1893 Chicago world's fair. It had a diameter of 250 feet, and the boarding platform, at the base of the wheel, was 14 feet above the ground. If you boarded the wheel and rotated through an angle of \(50\degree\text{,}\) what would be your height above the ground?</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">47</span></h5>
<p>To find the distance across a ravine, Delbert takes some measurements from a small airplane. When he is a short distance from the ravine at an altitude of 500 feet, he finds that the angle of depression to the near side of the ravine is \(56\degree\text{,}\) and the angle of depression to the far side is \(32\degree\text{.}\) What is the width of the ravine?  (Hint:  First find the horizontal distance from Delbert to the near side of the ravine.)</p></article><article class="exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">48</span></h5>
<p>The window in Francine's office is 4 feet wide and 5 feet tall. The bottom of the window is 3 feet from the floor.  When the sun is at an angle of elevation of \(64\degree\text{,}\) what is the area of the sunny spot on the floor?</p></article>
