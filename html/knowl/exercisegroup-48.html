<p>The scatterplot shows the outside temperature and the number of cups of cocoa sold at an outdoor skating rink snack bar on 13 consecutive nights. <object type="image/svg+xml" style="width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;" data="images/fig-ex-1-6-12.svg" alt="scatterplot"><p style="margin:auto">&lt;&lt;SVG image is unavailable, or your browser cannot render it&gt;&gt;</p></object> </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><p>How many cups of cocoa were sold when the temperature was \(2\degree\)C?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the temperature on the night when \(25\) cups of cocoa were sold?</p></li>
<li><p>Use a straightedge to draw a line of best fit through the data points</p></li>
<li><p>Use your line of best fit to predict the number of cups of cocoa that will be sold at the snack bar if the temperature is \(7\degree\)C.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose two points on your regression line and find its equation.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the equation to predict the number of cups of cocoa that will be sold when the temperature is \(10\degree\)C and when the temperature is \(24\degree\)C. Are these predictions reasonable?</p></li>
