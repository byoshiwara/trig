<p>The surveyors began by measuring a baseline near Madras. The baseline was the only distance they measured; all other distances were calculated from it using measured angles.  Each calculated distance became the base side of another triangle used to calculate the distance to another point, which in turn started another triangle. Eventually this process formed a chain of triangles connecting the origin point to other locations.</p>
