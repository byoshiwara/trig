<p>Howard wants to fly from Anchorage to Nome, Alaska, a distance of 540 miles on a heading \(57\degree\) west of north. After flying for some time, he discovers that his heading is in error, and he is actually flying \(47\degree\) west of north. Howard corrects his flight plan and changes course when he is exactly 200 miles from Anchorage. What is his new heading, and how far is he from Nome?</p>
