<title>Solving Equations</title>

<subsection><title>Introduction</title>

<p>Now that we understand that trigonometric functions can be used to model rotations and cyclical behavior, we can begin to consider some applications. An important part of any model involves solving equations. In Chapter 4 we solved simple trigonometric equations, and now we are equipped to tackle more challenging ones.</p>

<assemblage> <title>Algebra Refresher</title>
<p>It is important to distinguish between an algebraic <em>expression</em> and an <em>equation</em>.  An <term>equation</term><idx><h>equation</h></idx> is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal.  It may be true or false, depending on the values of any variables involved.  Here are some examples of equations.
    <md><mrow>5(2 + 6) \amp = 5(2) + 5(6)</mrow>
        <mrow>\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}\amp= 3 + 4</mrow>
        <mrow>x^2 + 3x \amp = 10</mrow></md>
The first equation is true, the second is false, and the third equation is true only if <m>x = 2</m> or <m>x = -5</m>.  When you <term>solve</term><idx><h>solve</h><h>an equation</h></idx> an equation, you are finding the values of the variable that make the equation true.</p></assemblage>

<p>You already know several algebraic techniques for solving equations of different types. But sometimes simple trial and error is the best approach.</p>

<example><statement><p><ol marker="a.">
    <li>Evaluate <m>~~2x + \sqrt[3]{x - 1}</m> for <m>x = 9</m>.</li>
    <li>Solve <m>~~2x + \sqrt[3]{x - 1} = 20</m>.</li>
</ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol marker="a.">
    <li>Substitute <m>x = 9</m> into the expression to find
        <md><mrow>2x + \sqrt[3]{x - 1} \amp = 2(\alert{9}) + \sqrt[3]{\alert{9} - 1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 18 +  \sqrt[3]{8} = 20</mrow></md></li>
    <li>We must find a value for <m>x</m> that makes <m>2x + \sqrt[3]{x - 1}</m> equal to <m>20</m>. In part (a) we saw that this expression equals <m>20</m> when <m>x = 9</m>, so the solution of the equation <m>~2x + \sqrt[3]{x - 1} = 20~</m> is <m>x = 9</m>.</li>
</ol></p></solution></example>

<exercise><statement><p>Use trial and error to find a solution of the equation
<me>2x^3 - 4x = 5x^2 - 3</me>
</p></statement><hint><p>Try small integer values for <m>x</m>.</p></hint>
<answer><p><m>x = 3</m></p></answer></exercise>

<p> Another useful equation-solving method uses graphs. <idx><h>solve</h><h>an equation using a graph</h></idx></p>

<example><statement><p>Use a graph to solve the equation <m>~x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x = -6</m>.</p>
</statement>

<solution><p>We graph the expressions on either side of the equation, that is, we graph <m>~y = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x~</m> and <m>y = -6</m>  on the same grid, as shown below.</p> 
    <sidebyside widths="55% 32%" margins="0% 5%"> 
<p> We are looking for any values of <m>x</m> where the two <m>y</m>-values are equal, and these occur at the intersection points of the two graphs. At those points, the <m>x</m>-values are <m>x = -2,~ x = 1</m> and <m>x = 3</m>, and these are the solutions of the equation. You can check that all three values make the equation true.</p>

<p>From the graph, we see that <m>h = 240</m> at approximately 215 seconds (or 3 minutes and 35 seconds) and 325 seconds (or 5 minutes and 25 seconds) into the ride. Your height is more than 240 feet between those two times, or for about 110 seconds.</p>

<p>In the example above, we used a graph to solve the equation <m>h = 240</m>, or
        <me>139 - 125\cos \left(\dfrac{2t}{3}\right) = 240</me> 
To find a more precise solution, we can use algebraic methods. To start, we'll solve the slightly simpler equation
        <me>139 - 125\cos(\theta) = 240</me>  
We'll look for all solutions for <m>\theta</m> between <m>0\degree</m> and <m>360\degree</m>. We begin by isolating the trigonometric ratio on one side of the equation.
    <md><mrow>139 - 125\cos (\theta) \amp = 240  \amp \amp \blert{\text{Subtract 139 from both sides.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>- 125\cos (\theta)   \amp = 101 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by }{-125.}}</mrow>
        <mrow> \cos(\theta) \amp = -0.808</mrow></md>
We have solved equations like this one before:  we use the inverse cosine to solve for <m>\theta</m>.  Remember that there are two angles between <m>0\degree</m> and <m>360\degree</m> that have a cosine of <m>-0.808</m>, one in the second quadrant and one in the third quadrant.  The calculator will give us only the second quadrant solution.
        <me>\theta = \cos^{-1}(-0.808) = 143.9\degree</me> 
To find the second solution, we need the third-quadrant angle whose cosine is <m>-0.808</m>. </p>

<sidebyside widths="55% 40%" margins="0% 0%" valigns="middle middle">
    <p> Now, the reference angle for <m>143.9\degree</m> is  
        <me>180\degree - 143.9\degree = 36.1\degree</me>  
    and the angle in the third quadrant with the same reference angle is  
        <me>180\degree + 36.1\degree = 216.1\degree</me>  
    (See the figure at right.)  Thus, the other solution is <m>216.1\degree</m>.</p>

<p> To solve simple equations involving a single trigonometric ratio (either <m>\sin (\theta), \cos (\theta),</m> or <m>\tan (\theta)</m>), we can follow the steps below.</p>

<note><p>In step 3, note that if the first solution is a quadrantal angle, there may not be a second solution. Consider, for example, the equation <m>\cos (\theta) = -1</m>.</p></note> 

<p>To finish up our Ferris wheel example, we can replace <m>\theta</m> by <m>\dfrac{2t}{3}</m> to get two equations:</p>

<p>Each intersection represents a solution of the equation. Thus, all of the angles coterminal with <m>30\degree</m> and <m>150\degree</m> are also solutions. We can easily find these solutions by adding integer multiples of <m>360\degree</m> to <m>30\degree</m> or <m>150\degree</m>. This is why, when solving a trigonometric equation, we usually list only the solutions in one cycle, typically those between <m>0\degree</m> and <m>360\degree</m>.</p>

<subsection><title>Equations with Squares of Trig Ratios</title>
    <idx><h>trigonometric equation</h><h>with squares of trig ratios</h></idx>

<p> You know several techniques for solving quadratic equations. Simple quadratic equations can be solved by extracting roots.  For example, to solve the equation
        <me>4x^2 + 3 = 15</me>
we first isolate <m>x^2</m>:
        <md><mrow>4x^2 \amp = 12</mrow>
            <mrow>x^2 \amp = 3</mrow></md>
and then take square roots of both sides to find
        <me>x = \pm \sqrt{3} \approx \pm 1.732</me>
Recall that a quadratic equation may have two real solutions, one (repeated) real solution, or no real solutions.  We can use extraction of roots to solve trigonometric equations as well.</p>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~~4 \tan^2 (\theta) + 3 = 15~~ </m> for <m>0\degree \le\theta\le 360\degree</m>.</p>
</statement>

<solution><p>We begin by isolating the power of tangent, <m>\tan^2 \theta</m>.
    <md><mrow>4\tan^2 (\theta) \amp = 12</mrow>
        <mrow>\tan^2 (\theta) \amp = 3</mrow></md>
Next, we solve for <m>\tan (\theta)</m>  by extracting roots.
        <me>\tan (\theta) = \pm \sqrt{3}</me>
There are two angles between <m>0\degree</m> and <m>360\degree</m> with tangent <m>\sqrt{3}</m> and two angles with tangent <m>-\sqrt{3}</m>, making four solutions to this equation. We know that <m>\tan (60\degree) = \sqrt{3}</m>,  so one of the solutions is <m>60\degree</m>. </p>

<sidebyside widths="60% 25%" valigns="middle middle" margins="0% 10%">
<p> The tangent function is also positive in the third quadrant, and the angle in the third quadrant with reference angle <m>60\degree</m> is <m>180\degree + 60\degree = 240\degree</m>. The angles in the second and fourth quadrants with reference angle <m>60\degree</m> have tangent <m>-\sqrt{3}</m>.  These angles are  </p>

<exercise><statement><p>Solve the equation <m>~~2\sin^2 (\theta) = 1~~</m> for <m>0\degree \le\theta\le 360\degree</m>.</p></statement>

<answer><p><m>\theta = 45\degree</m>, <m>~\theta = 135\degree</m>, <m>~\theta = 225\degree~</m>,  or <m>~\theta = 315\degree</m></p></answer></exercise>

<p>Other quadratic equations can be solved by factoring. For example, we can solve the equation
        <me>4x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0</me> 
by factoring the left side to get
        <me>(2x + 3)(2x - 1) = 0</me>
Then we apply the Zero Factor Principle to set each factor equal to zero, and solve each equation.
        <md><mrow>2x + 3\amp = 12 \amp 2x - 1\amp= 0</mrow>
            <mrow>x \amp = \dfrac{-3}{2}  \amp x \amp= \dfrac{1}{2}</mrow></md>
 The solutions are <m>\dfrac{-3}{2}</m> and <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m>.</p>   

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~~2 \cos^2 (\theta) - \cos (\theta) - 1 = 0~~</m> for <m>0\degree \le\theta\le 360\degree</m>.</p></statement>

 <solution><p>Compare this equation to the algebraic equation <m>~2x^2 - x - 1 = 0</m>. Our equation has the same algebraic form, but with <m>x</m> replaced by <m>\cos (\theta) </m>. </p>
 <p>We can solve the algebraic equation by factoring <m>~2x^2 - x - 1~</m> as <m>~(2x + 1)(x - 1),</m> and we'll use the same strategy on the trigonometric equation. 
    <md><mrow>2 \cos^2 (\theta) - \cos (\theta) - 1 \amp = 0 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Factor the left side.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\Big(2\cos (\theta) + 1\Big)\Big(\cos (\theta) - 1\Big) \amp = 0  \amp \amp \blert{\text{Set each factor equal to zero.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\cos (\theta) = \dfrac{-1}{2} ~~ \text{ or } ~~\cos (\theta) \amp= 1\amp</mrow></md>           
Now we solve each equation for <m>\theta</m>. We know that <m>\cos (60\degree) = \dfrac {1}{2},</m> and the cosine function is negative in the second and third quadrants. The angles in those quadrants with reference angle <m>60\degree</m> are
        <me>180\degree - 60\degree = 120\degree ~~~\text{and} ~~~ 180\degree + 60\degree = 240\degree</me>
Also, <m>\cos (\theta) = 1</m>  when <m>\theta = 0\degree</m>. Thus, the original equation has three solutions: <m>\theta = 120\degree, ~ \theta = 240\degree,</m> and <m>\theta = 0\degree.</m></p>
</solution></example> 

<exercise><statement><p>Solve <m>~~9 \sin^2 (\theta) - 3 \sin (\theta) = 2~~</m> for <m>0\degree \le\theta\le 360\degree</m>. Round your answers to the nearest degree.</p>
</statement>

<answer><p>We first solve the equation <m>~9 \sin^2 (\theta) - 3 \sin (\theta) - 2 = 0~</m> by factoring:
        <me>(3\sin(\theta) - 2)(3\sin(\theta) + 1) = 0</me>, 
    so <m>\sin(\theta) = \dfrac{2}{3}</m> or <m>\sin(\theta) = \dfrac{-1}{3}</m>. From the first equation we find <m>\theta = 42\degree</m> and <m>~\theta = 138\degree</m>, and from the second euqtion we find <m>\theta = 199\degree~</m> and <m>~\theta = 341\degree</m>.</p>
