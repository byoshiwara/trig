<title>Solving Equations</title>

<subsection><title>Introduction</title>

<p>It is important to distinguish between an algebraic <em>expression</em> and an <em>equation</em>.  An <term>equation</term><idx><h>equation</h></idx> is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal.  It may be true or false, depending on the values of any variables involved.  Here are some examples of equations.
    <md><mrow>5(2 + 6) \amp = 5(2) + 5(6)</mrow>
        <mrow>\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}\amp= 3 + 4</mrow>
        <mrow>x^2 + 3x \amp = 10</mrow></md>
The first equation is true, the second is false, and the third equation is true only if <m>x = 2</m> or <m>x = -5</m>.  When you <term>solve</term><idx><h>solve</h><h>an equation</h></idx> an equation, you are finding the values of the variable that make the equation true.</p>

<example><statement><p><ol marker="a">
    <li>Evaluate <m>~~2x + \sqrt[3]{x - 1}</m> for <m>x = 9</m>.</li>
    <li>Solve <m>~~2x + \sqrt[3]{x - 1} = 20</m>.</li>
</ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol marker="a">
    <li>Substitute <m>x = 9</m> into the expression to find
        <md><mrow>2x + \sqrt[3]{x - 1} \amp = 2(\alert{9}) + \sqrt[3]{\alert{9} - 1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 18 +  \sqrt[3]{8} = 20</mrow></md></li>
    <li>We must find a value for <m>x</m> that makes <m>2x + \sqrt[3]{x - 1}</m> equal to 20.  In part (a) we saw that this expression equals 20 when <m>x = 9</m>, so the solution of the equation <m>2x + \sqrt[3]{x - 1} = 20</m> is <m>x = 9</m>.</li>
</ol></p></solution></example>

<exercise><statement><p>Use trial and error to find a solution of the equation
<me>2x^3 - 4x = 5x^2 - 3</me>
</p></statement><hint><p>Try small integer values for <m>x</m>.</p></hint><answer><p><m>x = 3</m></p></answer></exercise>

<p> You probably remember a number of algebraic techniques for solving equations of different types.  Another useful equation-solving method uses graphs. <idx><h>solve</h><h>an equation using a graph</h></idx></p>

<example><statement><p>Use a graph to solve the equation  <m>x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x = -6</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We graph the expressions on either side of the equation, that is, we graph <m>y = x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x</m> and <m>y = -6</m>  on the same grid, as shown below.</p> <sidebyside widths="55% 32%" margins="0% 5%"> <p> We are looking for any values of <m>x</m> where the two <m>y</m>-values are equal, and these occur at the intersection points of the two graphs.  At those points, the <m>x</m>-values are <m>x = -2,~ x = 1</m> and <m>x = 3</m>, and these are the solutions of the equation.  You can check that all three values make the equation true.</p>

<p> The first Ferris wheel was built for the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.  It had a diameter of 250 feet and could carry 2160 people in 36 carriages.  From the top of the wheel, passengers could see into four states.  After loading all the passengers, the wheel made one revolution in nine minutes.</p>  
<p>If you are in the bottom carriage of the Ferris wheel at the start of its revolution, your height after <m>t</m> seconds is given by
    <me>h = f(t) = 139 - 125\cos \left(\dfrac{2t}{3}\right)</me>  
For how long are you more than 240 feet above the ground?</p>

<p>From the graph, we see that <m>h = 240</m> at approximately 215 seconds and 325 seconds into the ride.  Your height is more than 240 feet between those two times, or for about 110 seconds.</p>

<idx><h>solve</h><h>trigonometric equations</h></idx>
<idx><h>solve</h><h>trigonometric equations</h><seealso>trigonometric equation</seealso></idx>

<p>In the example above, we used a graph to solve the equation <m>h = 240</m>, or
    <me>139 - 125\cos \left(\dfrac{2t}{3}\right) = 240</me> 
To find a more precise solution, we can use algebraic methods.  As an example, we'll solve the slightly simpler equation
    <me>139 - 125\cos\theta = 240</me>  
We'll look for all solutions for <m>\theta</m> between <m>0\degree</m> and <m>360\degree</m>.  We begin by isolating the trigonometric ratio on one side of the equation.
    <md><mrow>139 - 125\cos \theta \amp = 240  \amp \amp \blert{\text{Subtract 139 from both sides.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>- 125\cos \theta   \amp = 101 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by }{-125.}}</mrow>
        <mrow> \cos\theta \amp = -0.808</mrow></md>
We have solved equations like this one before:  we use the inverse cosine to solve for <m>\theta</m>.  Remember that there are two angles between <m>0\degree</m> and <m>360\degree</m> that have a cosine of <m>-0.808</m>, one in the second quadrant and one in the third quadrant.  The calculator will give us only the second quadrant solution.
    <me>\theta = \cos^{-1}(-0.808) = 143.9\degree</me> 
To find the second solution, we need the third-quadrant angle whose cosine is <m>-0.808</m>. </p>

<sidebyside widths="55% 40%" margins="0% 0%" valigns="middle middle">
<p> Now, the reference angle for <m>143.9\degree</m> is  
    <me>180\degree - 143.9\degree = 36.1\degree</me>  
and the angle in the third quadrant with the same reference angle is  
    <me>180\degree + 36.1\degree = 216.1\degree</me>  
(See the figure at right.)  Thus, the other solution is <m>216.1\degree</m>.</p>

<p>Each intersection represents a solution of the equation.  Thus, all of the angles coterminal with <m>30\degree</m> and <m>150\degree</m> are also solutions.  We can easily find these solutions by adding integer multiples of <m>360\degree</m> to <m>30\degree</m> or <m>150\degree</m>.  This is why, when solving a trigonometric equation, we usually list only the solutions in one cycle, typically those between <m>0\degree</m> and <m>360\degree</m>.</p></note>

 <subsection><title>Equations with Squares of Trig Ratios</title>
 <idx><h>trigonometric equation</h><h>with squares of trig ratios</h></idx>

<p> Simple quadratic equations can be solved by extracting roots.  For example, to solve the equation
    <me>4x^2 + 3 = 15</me>
we first isolate <m>x^2</m>:
    <md><mrow>4x^2 \amp = 12</mrow>
        <mrow>x^2 \amp = 3</mrow></md>
and then take square roots of both sides to find
    <me>x = \pm \sqrt{3} \approx \pm 1.732</me>
Recall that a quadratic equation may have two real solutions, one (repeated) real solution, or no real solutions.  We can use extraction of roots to solve trigonometric equations as well.</p>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~~4 \tan^2 \theta + 3 = 15~~ </m> for <m>0\degree \le\theta\le 360\degree</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We begin by isolating the power of tangent, <m>\tan^2 \theta</m>.
    <md><mrow>4\tan^2 \theta \amp = 12</mrow>
        <mrow>\tan^2 \theta \amp = 3</mrow></md>
Next, we solve for <m>\tan \theta</m>  by extracting roots.
    <me>\tan \theta = \pm \sqrt{3}</me>
There are two angles between <m>0\degree</m> and <m>360\degree</m> with tangent <m>\sqrt{3}</m> and two angles with tangent <m>-\sqrt{3}</m>, making four solutions to this equation. We know that <m>\tan 60\degree = \sqrt{3}</m>,  so one of the solutions is <m>60\degree</m>. </p>

<p>Other quadratic equations can be solved by factoring.  For example, we can solve the equation
    <me>4x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0</me> 
by factoring the left side to get
    <me>(2x + 3)(2x - 1) = 0</me>
Then we apply the Zero Factor Principle to set each factor equal to zero, and solve each equation.
    <md><mrow>2x + 3\amp = 12 \amp 2x - 1\amp= 0</mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp = \dfrac{-3}{2}  \amp x \amp= \dfrac{1}{2}</mrow></md>
 The solutions are <m>\dfrac{-3}{2}</m> and <m>\dfrac{1}{2}</m>.</p>   

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~~2 \cos^2 \theta - \cos \theta - 1 = 0~~</m> for <m>0\degree \le\theta\le 360\degree</m>.</p></statement>

 <solution><p>Compare this equation to the algebraic equation <m>2x^2 - x - 1 = 0</m>.  Our equation has the same algebraic form, but with <m>x</m> replaced by <m>\cos \theta </m>. </p>
 <p>We can solve the algebraic equation by factoring <m>2x^2 - x - 1</m> as <m>(2x + 1)(x - 1),</m> and we'll use the same strategy on the trigonometric equation. 
    <md><mrow>2 \cos^2 \theta - \cos \theta - 1 \amp = 0 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Factor the left side.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>(2\cos \theta + 1)(\cos \theta - 1) \amp = 0  \amp \amp \blert{\text{Set each factor equal to zero.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\cos \theta = \dfrac{-1}{2} ~~ \text{ or } ~~\cos \theta \amp= 1\amp</mrow></md>           
Now we solve each equation for <m>\theta</m>.  We know that <m>\cos 60\degree = \dfrac {1}{2},</m> and the cosine function is negative in the second and third quadrants.  The angles in those quadrants with reference angle <m>60\degree</m> are
    <me>180\degree - 60\degree = 120\degree ~~~\text{and} ~~~ 180\degree + 60\degree = 240\degree</me>
Also, <m>\cos \theta = 1</m>  when <m>\theta = 0\degree</m>.  Thus, the original equation has three solutions: <m>\theta = 120\degree, ~ \theta = 240\degree,</m> and <m>\theta = 0\degree.</m></p></solution></example>
