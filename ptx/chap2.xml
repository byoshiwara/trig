 <p>How would you measure the distance to an inaccessible obect, such as a ship at sea? 
In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales estimated the distances to ships at sea using <term>triangulation</term><idx><h>triangulation</h></idx>, a method for calculating distances by forming triangles. Using trigonometry and the measured length of just one side, the lengths of the other sides can be calculated.</p>
<p>	Triangulation has been used to compute distances ever since. In the 16th century mapmakers began to use triangulation to position far-away places accurately. And as new methods in navigation and astronomy required greater precision, the idea of a survey using chains of triangles was developed.</p>
<p>In 1802, the East India Company embarked on the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. Its goal was to measure the entire Indian subcontinent with scientific precision.</p> 
 
<sidebyside><image source="photos/ch2-2.png"><description>design</description></image></sidebyside> 

<p>The surveyors began by measuring a baseline near Madras. The baseline was the only distance they measured; all other distances were calculated from it using measured angles.  Each calculated distance became the base side of another triangle used to calculate the distance to another point, which in turn started another triangle. Eventually this process formed a chain of triangles connecting the origin point to other locations.</p>
<p>Because of the size of the area to be surveyed, the surveyors did not triangulate the whole of India but instead created what they called a "gridiron" of triangulation chains running from North to South and East to West. You can see these chains in the map of the survey.</p>
<p>The Survey was completed in 1871. Along the way it calculated the height of the Himalayan giants: Everest, K2, and Kanchenjunga, and provided one of the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude.</p>
<p>	Triangulation today is used for many purposes, including surveying, navigation, metrology, astrometry, binocular vision, and location of earthquakes.</p>
