<title>Quadratic Inequalities</title>

<subsection><title>Solving Inequalities Graphically</title>
<p>
	In <xref ref="chap1" text="type-global"/>, we used graphs to solve equations and inequalities. The graphing technique is especially helpful for solving quadratic inequalities.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-fireworks">
	<p>
		The Chamber of Commerce in River City plans to put on a Fourth of July fireworks display. City regulations require that fireworks at public gatherings explode higher than <m>800</m> feet above the ground. The mayor particularly wants to include the Freedom Starburst model, which is launched from the ground. Its height after t seconds is given by
		<me>h = 256t - 16t^2</me>
		When should the Starburst explode in order to satisfy the safety regulation?
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		We can get an approximate answer to this question by looking at the graph of the rocket's height, shown in <xref ref="fig-fireworks" text="type-global"/>.
		<figure xml:id="fig-fireworks"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-fireworks"  width="50%"><description>graph of fireworks height</description></image> </figure>
		When is the rocket's height greater than 800 feet, or, in mathematical terms, for what values of <m>t</m> is <m>h \gt 800</m>? The answer to this question is the solution of the inequality
		<me>256t - 16t^2 \gt 800</me>
		Points on the graph with <m>h \gt 800</m> are shown in color, and the <m>t</m>-coordinates of those points are marked on the horizontal axis. If the Freedom Starburst explodes at any of these times, it will satisfy the safety regulation.</p> 
		<p></p> 
		<p>From the graph, the safe time interval runs from approximately <m>4.25</m> seconds to <m>11.75</m> seconds after launch. The solution of the inequality is the set of all <m>t</m>-values greater than <m>4.25</m> but less than <m>11.75</m>.
	</p></solution></example>

<p>
	The solution set in <xref ref="example-fireworks" text="type-global"/> is called a <term>compound inequality</term><idx>compound inequality</idx>, because it involves more than one inequality symbol. We write this set as
	<me>4.25 \lt t \lt 11.75</me>
	and read "<m>t</m> greater than <m>4.25</m> but less than <m>11.75</m>."
</p>

<p>
	You can use your graphing calculator to solve the problem in <xref ref="example-fireworks" text="type-global"/>. Graph the two equations
	
		\begin{align}
		Y_1 \amp= 256X - 16X^2\\
		Y_2 \amp= 800
		\end{align}
	
	on the same screen. Use <c>WINDOW</c> settings to match the graph in <xref ref="fig-GC-fireworks" text="type-global"/>. Then use the intersect feature to find the <m>x</m>-coordinates of the points where the two graphs intersect (there are two of them). These points will have <m>y</m>-coordinates of <m>800</m>. The parabola is above the line, so <m>h \gt 800</m> when <m>t</m> is between these two <m>x</m>-values. To two decimal places, you can see that <m>h \gt 800</m> when <m>4.26 \lt t \lt 11.74</m>.

<note><p>
	In <xref ref="example-fireworks" text="type-global"/>, we solved the inequality <m>256t - 16t^2 \gt 800</m> by comparing points on the graph of <m>h = 256 - 16t^2</m> with points on the line <m>h = 800</m>. If one side of an inequality is zero, we can compare points on the graph with the line <m>y = 0</m>, which is the <m>x</m>-axis.

	Because it is relatively easy to decide whether the <m>y</m>-coordinate of a point on a graph is positive or negative (the point lies above the <m>x</m>-axis or below the x-axis), we often rewrite a given inequality so that one side is zero.

<subsection><title>Solving Quadratic Inequalities Algebraically</title>
<p>
	Although a graph is very helpful in solving inequalities, it is not completely necessary. Every quadratic inequality can be put into one of the forms
	<me>
		\begin{aligned}
		ax^2 + bx + c \amp\lt 0\text{,}
		\amp\hphantom{blank} ax2 + bx + c \amp\gt 0\\
		ax^2 + bx + c \amp\le 0\text{,}
		\amp\hphantom{blank} ax2 + bx + c \amp\ge 0\\
		\end{aligned}
	</me>
	All we really need to know is whether the corresponding parabola <m>y = ax^2 + bx + c</m> opens upward or downward. Consider the parabolas shown in <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas" text="type-global"/>.
	<figure xml:id="fig-two-parabolas"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-two-parabolas"  width="50%"><description>one parabola opens up, the other opens down</description></image> </figure>
</p>
<p>
	The parabola in <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas" text="type-global"/>a opens upward. It crosses the <m>x</m>-axis at two points, <m>x = r_1</m> and <m>x = r_2</m>. At these points, <m>y = 0</m>. </p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The graph lies below the <m>x</m>-axis between <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>, so the solutions to the inequality <m>y\lt 0</m> lie between <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>.</p></li> 
		<li><p>The graph lies above the <m>x</m>-axis for <m>x</m>-values less than <m>r_1</m> or greater than <m>r_2</m>, so the solutions to the inequality <m>y\gt 0</m> are <m>x\lt r_1</m> or <m>x\gt r_2</m>.</p></li>
	</ul>	
<p>
	If the parabola opens downward, as in <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas" text="type-global"/>b, the situation is reversed. The solutions to the inequality <m>y\gt 0</m> lie between the <m>x</m>-intercepts, and the solutions to <m>y\lt 0</m> lie outside the <m>x</m>-intercepts.
</p>
<p>
	From the graphs in <xref ref="fig-two-parabolas" text="type-global"/>, we see that the <m>x</m>-intercepts are the boundary points between the portions of the graph with positive <m>y</m>-coordinates and the portions with negative <m>y</m>-coordinates. To solve a quadratic inequality, we need only locate the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the corresponding graph and then decide which intervals of the <m>x</m>-axis produce the correct sign for <m>y</m>.

	If we cannot find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph by factoring or extraction of roots, we can use the quadratic formula.
</p>

<example>

				<p>The graph lies above the <m>x</m>-axis, and hence <m>y \gt 0</m>, for <m>x</m>-values between the two <m>x</m>-intercepts, that is, for <m>122.54 \lt x \lt 277.46</m>. Because we cannot produce a fraction of a parka, we restrict the interval to the closest whole number <m>x</m>-values included, namely <m>123</m> and <m>277</m>. Thus, TrailGear can produce as few as <m>123</m> parkas or as many as <m>277</m> parkas per month to keep its profit above <m>$2000</m>.</p>

			<li>We would like to solve the inequality

					<me>-0.8x^2 + 320x - 27,200 \gt 0</me>
			</li>
			<li>Consider the equation
					<me>
						y = -0.8x^2 + 320x - 27,200
					</me>
					We locate the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph by setting <m>y = 0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>. We will use the quadratic formula to solve the equation
					<me>-0.8x^2 + 320x - 27,200 = 0</me>
					so <m>a = \alert{-0.8}</m>, <m>b = \alert{320}</m>, and <m>c = \alert{-27,200}</m>.
					<me>
						\begin{aligned}
						x \amp=\frac{-(\alert{320})\pm\sqrt{(\alert{320})^2 - 4(-0.8)(\alert{-27,200})}} {2(\alert{-0.8})}\\
						\amp=\frac{-320\pm\sqrt{102,400 - 87,040}}{-1.6}\\
						\amp=\frac{-320\pm\sqrt{15,360}}{-1.6}
						\end{aligned}

					To two decimal places, the solutions to the equation are <m>122.54</m> and <m>277.46</m>.
