<title>Exponential Growth and Decay</title>


<subsection><title>Exponential Growth</title>
<p>
    The functions in <xref ref="investigation-population-growth" text="type-global"/> describe <term>exponential growth</term>. During each time interval of a fixed length, the population is multiplied by a certain constant amount. In Part A, the bacteria population grows by a factor of <m>3</m> every day.
</p>
<sidebyside width="60%"><image source="images/fig-table-bacteria-population"><description>table of bacteria population</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>
    For this reason, we say that <m>3</m> is the <term>growth factor</term><idx>growth factor</idx> for the function. Functions that describe exponential growth can be expressed in a standard form.
</p>
<assemblage><title>Exponential Growth</title>
<p>
    The function
    <me>P(t) = P_0 b^t</me>
    models exponential growth.
</p>
<p>
    <m>P_0 = P(0)</m> is the <term>initial value</term><idx>initial value</idx> of <m>P</m>;
</p>
<p>
    <m>b</m> is the <term>growth factor</term><idx>growth factor</idx>.
</p>
</assemblage>

<p>
    For the bacteria population, we have
    <me>P(t) = 100 \cdot 3^t</me>
    so <m>P_0 = 100</m> and <m>b = 3</m>.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-bacteria">

    <ol label="a">
        <li><p>The initial value of the population was <m>P_0 = 300</m>, and its weekly growth factor is <m>b = 2</m>. Thus, a formula for the population after <m>t</m> weeks is

        <me>P(8) = 300 \cdot 2^8 = 76,800 \text{ bacteria}</me>
        Because <m>5</m> days is <m>\frac{5}{7}</m> of a week, after <m>5</m> days the population will be
        <me>P\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)= 300 \cdot 2^{5/7} = 492.2</me>
        We cannot have a fraction of a bacterium, so we round to the nearest whole number, <m>492</m>.</p></li>

<subsection><title>Growth Factors</title>
<p>
    In Part B of <xref ref="investigation-population-growth" text="type-global"/>, the rabbit population grew by a factor of <m>2</m> every <m>3</m> months.
</p>
<sidebyside width="60%"><image source="images/fig-table-rabbit-population"><description>table of rabbit population</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>
    To write the growth formula for this population, we divide the value of <m>t</m> by <m>3</m> to find the number of doubling periods.
    <me>P(t) = 60 \cdot 2^{t/3}</me>
    To see the growth factor for the function, we use the third law of exponents to write <m>2^{t/3}</m> in another form. Recall that to raise a power to a power, we multiply exponents, so
    <me>\left(2^{1/3}\right)^t = 2^{t (1/3)} = 2^{t/3}</me>
    The growth law for the rabbit population is thus
    <me>P(t) = 60 \cdot \left(2^{1/3}\right)^t</me>
    The initial value of the function is <m>P_0 = 60</m>, and the growth factor is <m>b = 2^{1/3}</m>, or approximately <m>1.26</m>. The rabbit population grows by a factor of about <m>1.26</m> every month.
</p>
<p>
    If the units are the same, a population with a larger growth factor grows faster than one with a smaller growth factor.
</p>   

<example xml:id="example-compare-growth-factors">
<p>
    A lab technician compares the growth of <m>2</m> species of bacteria. She starts <m>2</m> colonies of <m>50</m> bacteria each. Species A doubles in population every <m>2</m> days, and species B triples every <m>3</m> days. Find the growth factor for each species.
</p>
<solution><p>
    A function describing the growth of species A is
    <me>P(t) = 50 \cdot 2^{t/2} = 50 \cdot \left(\alert{2^{1/2}}\right)^t</me>
    so the growth factor for species A is <m>\alert{2^{1/2}}</m>, or approximately <m>1.41</m>. For species B,
    <me>P(t) = 50 \cdot 3^{t/3} = 50 \cdot \left(\alert{3^{1/3}}\right)^t</me>
     so the growth factor for species B is <m>\alert{3^{1/3}}</m>, or approximately <m>1.44</m>. Species B grows faster than species A.

<subsection><title>Percent Increase</title>
<p>
    Exponential growth occurs in other circumstances, too. For example, if the interest on a savings account is compounded annually, the amount of money in the account grows exponentially.
</p>
<p>
    Consider a principal of <dollar/>100 invested at 5<percent/> interest compounded annually. At the end of <m>1</m> year, the amount is
    \begin{align*}
    \text{Amount} \amp = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \\
    A \amp = P + Pr\\
    \amp = 100 + 100(0.05) = 105
    \end{align*}
    It will be more useful to write the formula for the amount after <m>1</m> year in factored form.
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = P + Pr \amp\amp \text{Factor out P.} \\
    \amp = P(1 + r)
    \end{align*}
    With this version of the formula, the calculation for the amount at the end of <m>1</m> year looks like this:
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = P(1 + r ) \\
    \amp = 100(1 + 0.05) \\
    \amp = 100(1.05) = \alert{105}
    \end{align*}
</p>
<p>
    The amount, <dollar/>105, becomes the new principal for the second year. To find the amount at the end of the second year, we apply the formula again, with <m>P = 105</m>.
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = P(1 + r ) \\
    \amp = 105(1 + 0.05) \\
    \amp = \alert{105}(1.05) = 110.25
    \end{align*}
    Observe that to find the amount at the end of each year, we multiply the principal by a factor of <m>1 + r = 1.05</m>. Thus, we can express the amount at the end of the second year as
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = [100(1.05)](1.05) \\
    \amp = 100(1.05)^2
    \end{align*}
    and at the end of the third year as
    \begin{align*}
    A \amp = \left[100(1.05)^2\right](1.05) \\
    \amp = 100(1.05)^3
    \end{align*}
</p>
<sidebyside><paragraphs width="70%">
<p>
    At the end of each year, we multiply the old balance by another factor of <m>1.05</m> to get the new amount. We organize our results into <xref ref="table-percent-increase" text="type-global"/>, where <m>A(t)</m> represents the amount of money in the account after <m>t</m> years. For this example, a formula for the amount after <m>t</m> years is

<p>
    In general, for an initial investment of <m>P</m> dollars at an interest rate <m>r</m> compounded annually, we have the following formula for the amount accumulated after <m>t</m> years.
</p>
<assemblage><title>Compound Interest</title><idx>compound interest</idx>
<p>
    The <term>amount A(t)</term> accumulated (principal plus interest) in an account bearing interest compounded annually is
    <me>A(t) = P(1 + r)^t</me>
    where 
    \begin{align*}
    \amp P \amp\amp \text{is the principal invested,} \\
    \amp r \amp\amp \text{is the interest rate,} \\
    \amp t \amp\amp \text{is the time period, in years.}
    \end{align*}
</p>
</assemblage>

<p>
    This function describes exponential growth with an initial value of <m>P</m> and a growth factor of <m>b = 1 + r</m>. The interest rate <m>r</m>, which indicates the <term>percent increase</term><idx>percent increase</idx> in the account each year, corresponds to a <term>growth factor</term><idx>growth factor</idx> of <m>1 + r</m>. The notion of percent increase is often used to describe the growth factor for quantities that grow exponentially.

    where <m>b \gt 1</m>. The function <m>P(t) = P_0b^t</m> is a <em>decreasing</em> function if <m>0 \lt b \lt 1</m>. In this case, we say that the function describes <term>exponential decay</term>, and the constant <m>b</m> is called the <term>decay factor</term><idx>decay factor</idx>. In <xref ref="investigation-exponential-decay" text="type-global"/>, we consider two examples of exponential decay.

<subsection><title>Decay Factors</title>
<p>
    Before <xref ref="example-inflation" text="type-global"/>, we noted that a percent increase of <m>r</m> (in decimal form) corresponds to a growth factor of <m>b = 1 + r</m>. A percent decrease of <m>r</m> corresponds to a decay factor of <m>b = 1 - r</m>. In Part B of <xref ref="investigation-exponential-decay" text="type-global"/>, each millimeter of plastic reduced the amount of light by <m>25</m><percent/>, so <m>r = 0.25</m>, and the decay factor for the function <m>P(x)</m> is
    \begin{align*}
    b \amp = 1 - r \\
    \amp= 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
    \end{align*}

<p>
    <m>L</m> is a linear function with initial value <m>5</m> and slope <m>2</m>; <m>E</m> is an exponential function with initial value <m>5</m> and growth factor <m>2</m>. In a way, the growth factor of an exponential function is analogous to the slope of a linear function: Each measures how quickly the function is increasing (or decreasing).</p>
    <p> However, for each unit increase in <m>t</m>, <m>2</m> units are <em>added</em> to the value of <m>L(t)</m>, whereas the value of <m>E(t)</m> is <em>multiplied</em> by <m>2</m>. An exponential function with growth factor <m>2</m> eventually grows much more rapidly than a linear function with slope <m>2</m>, as you can see by comparing the graphs in <xref ref="fig-linear-vs-exponential" text="type-global"/> or the function values in  <xref ref="table-linear">Tables</xref> and <xref ref="table-exponential" text="global"/>.

    A solar energy company sold <dollar/><m>80,000</m> worth of solar collectors last year, its first year of operation. This year its sales rose to <dollar/><m>88,000</m>, an increase of <m>10</m><percent/>. The marketing department must estimate its projected sales for the next <m>3</m> years.

            Let <m>L(t)</m> represent the company's total sales <m>t</m> years after starting business, where <m>t = 0</m> is the first year of operation. If sales grow linearly, then <m>L(t)</m> has the form <m>L(t) = mt + b</m>. Now <m>L(0) = 80,000</m>, so the intercept <m>b</m> is <m>80,000</m>. The slope <m>m</m> of the graph is
            <me>
                \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t}= 
                \frac{8000 \text{ dollars}}{1\text{ year}}= 
                8000 \text{ dollars/year}
            </me>
            where <m>\Delta S = 8000</m> is the increase in sales during the first year. Thus, <m>L(t) = 8000t + 80,000</m>, and sales grow by adding <dollar/><m>8000</m> each year. The expected sales total for the next year is
            <me>
                L(2) = 8000(2) + 80,000 = 96,000
            </me>
            The values of <m>L(t)</m> for <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=4</m> are shown in the middle column of <xref ref="table-linear-exponential" text="type-global"/>. The linear graph of <m>L(t)</m> is shown in <xref ref="fig-linear-vs-exponential2" text="type-global"/>.

            Let <m>E(t)</m> represent the company's sales assuming that sales will grow exponentially. Then <m>E(t)</m> has the form <m>E(t) = E_0b^t</m> . The percent increase in sales over the first year was <m>r = 0.10</m>, so the growth rate is
            <me>b = 1 + r = 1.10</me>
            The initial value, <m>E_0</m>, is <m>80,000</m>. Thus, <m>E(t) = 80,000(1.10)^t</m>, and sales grow by being multiplied each year by <m>1.10</m>. The expected sales total for the next year is
            <me>
                E(2) = 80,000(1.10)^2= 96,800

            The values of <m>E(t)</m> for <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=4</m> are shown in the last column of <xref ref="table-linear-exponential" text="type-global"/>. The exponential graph of <m>E(t)</m> is shown in <xref ref="fig-linear-vs-exponential2" text="type-global"/>.</p>

<exercise xml:id="exercise-depreciation"><statement>
A new car begins to depreciate in value as soon as you drive it off the lot. Some models depreciate linearly, and others depreciate exponentially. Suppose you buy a new car for <dollar/><m>20,000</m>, and <m>1</m> year later its value has decreased to <dollar/><m>17,000</m>.
<ol label="a">
    <li><p>
        If the value decreased linearly, what was its annual rate of decrease?
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        If the value decreased exponentially, what was its annual decay factor? What was its annual percent depreciation?
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Calculate the value of your car when it is <m>5</m> years old under each assumption, linear or exponential depreciation.
