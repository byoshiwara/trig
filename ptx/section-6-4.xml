<introduction>
<p>
	Many quadratic models arise as the product of two variables, one of which increases while the other decreases. For example, the area of a rectangle is the product of its length and its width, or <m>A = lw</m>. If we require that the rectangle have a certain perimeter, then as we increase its length, we must also decrease its width. (We analyzed this problem in <xref ref="investigation-Perimeter-and-Area" text="type-global"/> of <xref ref="chap2" text="type-global"/>.)
</p>
<p>
	For <xref ref="investigation-Revenue-from-Theater-Tickets" text="type-global"/>, recall the formula for the revenue from sales of an item:
	<me>\text{Revenue}= (\text{price of one item})(\text{number of items sold})</me>
	Usually, when the price of an item increases, the number of items sold decreases.
</p>

<investigation xml:id="investigation-Revenue-from-Theater-Tickets"><title>Revenue from Theater Tickets</title><statement>
<p>
	The local theater group sold tickets to its opening night performance for <m>\$5</m> and drew an audience of <m>100</m> people. The next night, the group reduced the ticket price by <m>\$0.25</m> and <m>10</m> more people attended; that is, <m>110</m> people bought tickets at <m>\$4.75</m> apiece. In fact, for each <m>\$0.25</m> reduction in ticket price, <m>10</m> additional tickets can be sold.

<subsection><title>Maximum or Minimum Values</title>
<p>
	Finding the maximum or minimum value for a variable expression is a common problem in many applications. For example, if you own a company that manufactures blue jeans, you might like to know how much to charge for your jeans in order to maximize your revenue.</p>
	<p> As you increase the price of the jeans, your revenue may increase for a while. But if you charge too much for the jeans, consumers will not buy as many pairs, and your revenue may actually start to decrease. Is there some optimum price you should charge for a pair of jeans in order to achieve the greatest revenue?
</p>

<example xml:id="example-maximum-revenue">
	<p>
		Late Nite Blues finds that it can sell <m>600 - 15x</m> pairs of jeans per week if it charges <m>x</m> dollars per pair. (Notice that as the price increases, the number of pairs of jeans sold decreases.)
		<ol label="a">
			<li><p>
				Write an equation for the revenue as a function of the price of a pair of jeans.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Graph the function.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				How much should Late Nite Blues charge for a pair of jeans in order to maximize its revenue?
			</p></li>
		</ol>
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		<ol label="a">
			<li><p>
				Using the formula for revenue stated above, we find
				<me>
					\begin{aligned}
					\text{Revenue} \amp= (\text{price of one item})(\text{number of items sold})\\
					R \amp = x(600 - 15x)\\
					R \amp = 600x - 15x^2
					\end{aligned}
				</me>
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				We recognize the equation as quadratic, so the graph is a parabola. You can use your calculator to verify the graph in <xref ref="fig-revenue-jeans-sales" text="type-global"/>.
				<figure xml:id="fig-revenue-jeans-sales"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-revenue-jeans-sales"  width="40%"><description>graph showing revenue from sales of jeans</description></image> </figure>
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				The maximum value of <m>R</m> occurs at the vertex of the parabola. Thus,
				<me>\begin{aligned} 
					x_v\amp=\frac{-b}{2a}=\frac{-600}{2(-15)}=20\\
					y_v\amp=600(\alert{20}) - 15(\alert{20})^2 = 6000
					\end{aligned}
				</me>
				The revenue takes on its maximum value when <m>x = 20</m>, and the maximum value is <m>R = 6000</m>. This means that Late Nite Blues should charge <m>\$20</m> for a pair of jeans in order to maximize revenue at <m>\$6000</m> a week.
			</p></li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</solution>
</example>
<note><p>
	If the equation relating two variables is quadratic, then the maximum or minimum value is easy to find: It is the value at the vertex. If the parabola opens downward, as in <xref ref="example-maximum-revenue" text="type-global"/>, there is a maximum value at the vertex. If the parabola opens upward, there is a minimum value at the vertex.

<subsection><title>The Vertex Form for a Parabola</title>
<p>
	Consider the quadratic equation
	<me>y = 2(x - 3)^2 - 8</me>
	By expanding the squared expression and collecting like terms, we can rewrite the equation in standard form as
	<me>\begin{aligned}
		y \amp= 2(x^2 - 6x + 9) - 8\\
		y \amp = 2x^2 - 12x + 10
		\end{aligned}
	</me>
	The vertex of this parabola is
	<me>\begin{aligned}
		x_v \amp= \frac{-(-12)}{2(2)}=3\\
		y_v \amp = 2(3)^2 - 12(3) + 10=-8
		\end{aligned}
	</me>
	and its graph is shown in <xref ref="fig-vertex-form" text="type-global"/>.
	<figure xml:id="fig-vertex-form"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-vertex-form"  width="30%"><description>parabola with vertex labeled</description></image> </figure>
</p>
<p>
	Notice that the coordinates of the vertex, <m>(3,-8)</m>, are apparent in the original equation; we don’t need to do any computation to find the vertex.
	<me>\begin{alignedat}{2}
		y = 2(x - \amp \alert{3})^2 ~ \amp\alert{- 8}\\
		\amp \alert{x_v} \amp \alert{y_v}
		\end{alignedat}
	</me>
	This equation is an example of the <term>vertex form</term><idx>vertex form</idx> for a quadratic function.
</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-vertex-form-of-quadratic.xml" />

<example xml:id="example-vertex-form">
	<p>
		Find the vertex of the graph of <m>y = -3(x - 4)^2 + 6</m>. Is the vertex a maximum or a minimum point of the graph?
	</p>
<solution><p>
	Compare the equation to the vertex form to see that the coordinates of the vertex are <m>(4, 6)</m>. For this equation, <m>a = -3 \lt 0</m>, so the parabola opens downward. The vertex is the maximum point of the graph.
</p></solution>
</example>

<p>
	To understand why the vertex form works, substitute <m>x_v = \alert{4}</m> into <m>y = -3(x - 4)^2 + 6</m> from <xref ref="example-vertex-form" text="type-global"/> to find
	<me>y = -3(\alert{4} - 4)^2 + 6 = 6</me>
	which confirms that when <m>x = 4</m>, <m>y = 6</m>. Next, notice that if <m>x</m> is any number except <m>4</m>, the expression <m>-3(x - 4)^2</m> is negative, so <m>y \lt 6</m>. Therefore, <m>6</m> is the maximum value for <m>y</m> on the graph, so <m>(4, 6)</m> is the high point or vertex.
</p>
<p>
	You can also rewrite <m>y = -3(x - 4)^2 + 6</m> in standard form and use the formula <m>x_v = \dfrac{-b}{2a}</m> to confirm that the vertex is the point <m>(4, 6)</m>.
</p>

</ol></p></answer>
</exercise>

<p>
	Any quadratic equation in vertex form can be written in standard form by expanding, and any quadratic equation in standard form can be put into vertex form by completing the square.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-write-in-vertex-form">
	<p>
		Write the equation <m>y = 3x^2 - 6x - 1</m> in vertex form and find the vertex of its graph.
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		We factor the lead coefficient, <m>3</m>, from the variable terms, leaving a space to complete the square.
		<me>y = 3(x^2 - 2x <fillin characters="6" /> ) - 1</me>
		Next, we complete the square inside parentheses. Take half the coefficient of <m>x</m> and square the result: <m>p = \frac{1}{2}(-2) = -1</m>, and <m>p^2 = (-1)^2 = 1</m>. We must add <m>1</m> to complete the square. However, we are really adding <m>3(1)</m> to the right side of the equation, so we must also subtract <m>3</m> to compensate:
		<me>y = 3(x^2 - 2x \alert{{}+{}1}) - 1\,\alert{-\,3}</me>
		The expression inside parentheses is now a perfect square, and the vertex form is
		<me>y = 3(x - 1)^2 - 4</me>
		The vertex of the parabola is <m>(1,-4)</m>.

<subsection><title>Graphing with the Vertex Form</title>
<p>
	We can also use the vertex form to sketch a graph, using what we know about transformations.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-graph-vertex-form">
	<p>
		Use transformations to graph <m>f(x) = -3(x - 4)^2 + 6</m>.
	</p>

<subsection><title>Systems Involving Quadratic Equations</title>
<p>
	Recall that the solution to a <m>2 \times 2</m> system of linear equations is the intersection point of the graphs of the equations. This is also true of systems in which one or both of the equations is quadratic. Such a system may have either one solution, two solutions, or no solutions. <xref ref="fig-3-cases-quadratic-system" text="type-global"/>  shows the three cases for systems of one quadratic and one linear equation. (See Algebra Review Refresher <xref ref="appendix-Linear-Systems-in-Two-Variables" text="type-global"/>.)
	<figure xml:id="fig-3-cases-quadratic-system"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-3-cases-quadratic-system"  width="70%"><description>graphs of 3 cases for quadratic system</description></image> </figure>
</p>

<p>
	In <xref ref="example-Pizza-system" text="type-global"/>, we use both graphical and algebraic techniques to solve the system.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-Pizza-system">
	<p>
		The Pizza Connection calculates that the cost, in dollars, of producing <m>x</m> pizzas per day is given by
		<me>C = 0.15x^2 + 0.75x + 180</me>
		The Pizza Connection charges <m>\$15</m> per pizza, so the revenue from selling <m>x</m> pizzas is
		<me>R = 15x</me>
		How many pizzas per day must the Pizza Connection sell in order to break even?
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		To break even means to make zero profit. Because
		<me>\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost}</me>
		the break-even points occur when revenue equals cost. In mathematical terms, we would like to find any values of <m>x</m> for which <m>R = C</m>.</p> 
		<p>If we graph the revenue and cost equations on the same axes, these values correspond to points where the two graphs intersect. Use the window settings
		
		\begin{align}
		\text{Xmin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 94\\
		\text{Ymin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 1400
		\end{align}
		on your calculator to obtain the graph shown in <xref ref="fig-GC-quadratic-system" text="type-global"/>. You can verify that the two intersection points are <m>(15, 225)</m> and <m>(80, 1200)</m>.
	</p>
	<figure xml:id="fig-GC-quadratic-system"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-GC-quadratic-system"  width="45%"><description>GC figure for quadratic system</description></image> </figure>
	<p>
		Thus, the Pizza Connection must sell either <m>15</m> or <m>80</m> pizzas in order to break even. On the graph we see that revenue is greater than cost for <m>x</m>-values between <m>15</m> and <m>80</m>, so the Pizza Connection will make a profit if it sells between <m>15</m> and <m>80</m> pizzas.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can also solve algebraically for the break-even points. The intersection points of the two graphs correspond to the solutions of the system of equations
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
			y\amp =0.15x^2 + 0.75x + 180\\
			y \amp= 15x
			\end{aligned}
		</me>
		We equate the two expressions for <m>y</m> and solve for <m>x</m>:
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
			0.15x^2 + 0.75x + 180 \amp= 15x\amp\amp\text{Subtract }15x \text{ from both sides.}\\
			0.15x^2 - 14.25x + 180 \amp= 0\amp\amp\text{Use the quadratic formula.}\\
			\end{aligned}
		</me>
		<me>
			\begin{aligned}
			x \amp= \frac{14.25 \pm\sqrt{14.252 - 4(0.15)(180)}}{2(-0.05)}\hphantom{blankblankblank}\\

<p>
	We can use the intersect feature of the graphing calculator to solve systems of quadratic equations. Consider the system
	<me>
		\begin{aligned}
		y \amp= (x + 1.1)^2\\
		y \amp = 7.825 - 2x - 2.5x^2
		\end{aligned}
	</me>
	We will graph these two equations in the standard window. The two intersection points are visible in the window, but we do not find their exact coordinates when we trace the graphs.</p> 
	<p>We can use the intersect command to locate one of the solutions, as shown in <xref ref="fig-GC-quadratic-system2" text="type-global"/>. You can check that the point <m>(0.9, 4)</m> is an exact solution to the system by substituting <m>x = 0.9</m> and <m>y = 4</m> into each equation of the system. (The calculator is not always able to find the exact coordinates, but it usually gives a very good approximation.)

<p>
	You can find the other solution of the system by following the same steps and moving the bug close to the other intersection point. You should verify that the other solution is the point <m>(-2.1, 1)</m>.
