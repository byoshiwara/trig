    <title>To Solve a Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square</title>
    <p>
		<ol label="*1*">
			<li>
				<ol label="a">
					<li>
						<p>Write the equation in standard form.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the quadratic term, and subtract the constant term from both sides.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Complete the square on the left side:
				<ol label="a">
					<li>
						Multiply the coefficient of the first-degree term by one-half, then square the result.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the value obtained in (a) to both sides of the equation.
					</li>
				</ol></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Write the left side of the equation as the square of a binomial. Simplify the right side.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Use extraction of roots to finish the solution.</p>
			</li>
