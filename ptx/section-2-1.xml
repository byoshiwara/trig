<title>Side and Angle Relationships</title>

<subsection><title>Introduction</title>

<p> From geometry we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180Â°.  Are there any relationships between the angles of a triangle and its sides?</p> <p> First of all, you have probably observed that the longest side in a triangle is always opposite the largest angle, and the shortest side is opposite the smallest angle, as illustrated below.</p>

<solution><p>Because <m>\angle G</m> is greater than <m>90\degree</m>, we know that <m>\angle F +\angle G</m> is greater than <m>90\degree + 48\degree = 138\degree</m>, so <m>\angle F</m> is less than <m>180\degree-138\degree = 42\degree.</m>  Thus, <m>\angle H \lt \angle F \lt \angle G,</m> and consequently <m>h \lt f \lt g</m>.  We can conclude that <m>h \lt 6</m> feet long, and <m>g \gt 6</m> feet long.</p>

<p>It is also true that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side, or else the two sides will not meet to form a triangle. This fact is called the triangle inequality.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>A 25-foot ladder is placed against a wall so that its foot is 7 feet from the base of the wall. How far up the wall does the ladder reach?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We make a sketch of the situation, as shown below, and label any known dimensions. We'll call the unknown height <m>h</m>.</p>
 <sidebyside widths="75% 15%" valigns="top top" margins="0% 5%"><p>The ladder forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, substituting 25 for <m>c</m>, 7 for <m>b</m>, and <m>h</m> for <m>a</m>.

<p>The Pythagorean theorem relates the sides of <em>right</em> triangles. However, for information about the sides of other triangles, the best we can do 
(without trigonometry!) is the triangle inequality. Nor does the Pythagorean theorem help us find the <em>angles</em> in a triangle.  In the next section we discover relationships between the angles and the sides of a right triangle.</p>
