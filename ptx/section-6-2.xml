<title>Solving Quadratic Equations</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	Not every quadratic equation can be solved by factoring or by extraction of roots. For example, the expression <m>x^2 + x - 1</m> cannot be factored, so the equation <m>x^2 + x - 1 = 0</m> cannot be solved by factoring. For other equations, factoring may be difficult. In this section we learn two methods that can be used to solve any quadratic equation.
</p>
</introduction>

<subsection><title>Squares of Binomials</title>
<p>
	In <xref ref="nonlinear-models" text="type-global"/> we used extraction of roots to solve equations of the form 
	<me>a( px + q)^2 + r = 0</me>
	where the left side of the equation includes the square of a binomial, or a <term>perfect square</term><idx>perfect square</idx>. We can write any quadratic equation in this form by <term>completing the square</term>.
</p>
<p>
	Consider the following squares of binomials.
</p><p>

<sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">
    <row bottom="major">
        <cell>Square of binomial <m>(x+p)^2</m></cell>
        <cell><m>p</m></cell>
        <cell><m>2p</m></cell>

        <cell><m>2(\alert{5})=10</m></cell>
        <cell><m>\alert{5}^2=25</m></cell>

    <row>
        <cell>2.  <m>(x\alert{{}-{}3})^2=x^2-6x+9</m></cell>
        <cell><m>\alert{-3}</m></cell>

        <cell><m>2(\alert{-12})=-24</m></cell>
        <cell><m>\alert{-12}^2=144</m></cell>
    </row>
</tabular></sidebyside></p>

<p>
	In each case, the square of the binomial is a quadratic trinomial,
	<me>(x + p)^2= x^2 + 2px + p^2</me>
	Note that the coefficient of the linear term, <m>2p</m>, is twice the constant in the binomial, and the constant term of the trinomial, <m>p^2</m>, is its square.
</p>
<p>
	We would like to reverse the process and write a quadratic expression as the square of a binomial. For example, what constant term can we add to
	<me>x^2 - 16x</me>
	to produce a perfect square trinomial? Compare the expression to the formula above:
	<me>
		\begin{alignedat}{4}
		x^2 \amp {}+{} \amp 2px \amp {}+{} \amp p^2 \amp {}={} \amp (x + p)^2 \\
		x^2 \amp {}-{} \amp 16x \amp {}+{} \amp \text{?} \amp {}={} \amp (x + \text{?})^2 \\
		\end{alignedat}
	</me>
	We see that 
	<me>2p = -16\text{, so }p = \frac{1}{2}(-16) = -8</me>
	and 
	<me>p^2 = (-8)^2 = 64</me> 
	Substitute these values for <m>p^2</m> and <m>p</m> into the equation to find
	<me>x^2 - 16x + 64 = (x - 8)^2</me>
	Notice that in the resulting trinomial, the constant term is equal to <em>the square of one-half the coefficient of</em> <m>x</m>. In other words, we can find the constant term by taking one-half the coefficient of <m>x</m> and then squaring the result. Adding a constant term obtained in this way is called <term>completing the square</term><idx>completing the square</idx>.

<note><p>
	You may find it helpful to visualize completing the square geometrically. We can think of the expression <m>x^2 + 2px</m> as the area of a rectangle with dimensions <m>x</m> and <m>x + 2p</m>.</p>
	<p> For example, the rectangle with length <m>x + 10</m> and width <m>x</m> has area <m>x(x + 10) = x^2 + 10x</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-completing-the-square" text="type-global"/>a. We would like to cut the rectangle into pieces and rearrange them so that we can make a square.</p>
	<p> In <xref ref="fig-completing-the-square" text="type-global"/>b, we move half of the <m>x</m>-term so that each side of the square has length <m>x + 5</m> (note that <m>p = \frac{1}{2} (10) = 5</m>), and in <xref ref="fig-completing-the-square" text="type-global"/>c we see that the missing corner piece has area <m>p^2 = 5^2 = 25</m>.

<subsection><title>Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square</title><idx>completing the square</idx>
<p>
	Now we will use completing the square to solve quadratic equations. First, we will solve equations in which the coefficient of the squared term is 1. Consider the equation 
	<me>x^2 - 6x - 7 = 0</me>
and follow the steps to find the solutions.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>
		Begin by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation, to get</p><p>
		<sidebyside><tabular><row><cell><m>x^2 - 6x{}<fillin characters="6"/> = 7</m></cell></row></tabular></sidebyside></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Now complete the square on the left. Because
		<me>p = \frac{1}{2}(-6) = -3 ~~~\text{ and } ~~~ p^2 = (-3)^2 = 9</me>
		we add <m>9</m> to <em>both</em> sides of our equation to get
		<me>x^2 - 6x \alert{{}+9}=7\alert{{}+9}</me>
	</li>
	<li>
		The left side of the equation is now the square of a binomial, namely <m>(x - 3)^2</m>. We write the left side in its square form and simplify the right side, which gives us
		<me>(x - 3)^2 =16</me>
		(You can check that this equation is equivalent to the original one; if you expand the left side and collect like terms, you will return to the original equation.)
	</li>
	<li>
		We can now use extraction of roots to find the solutions. Taking square roots of both sides, we get
		\begin{align*}
		x - 3 \amp =4 \amp\text{or}\amp\amp x - 3 \amp= -4\amp\text{Solve each equation.}\\
		x \amp =7 \amp\text{or}\amp\amp x \amp= -1
		\end{align*}
		The solutions are <m>7</m> and <m>-1</m>.
	</li>

	The graph of <m>y = x^2 - 6x - 7</m> is shown in <xref ref="fig-parabola-with-symmetry-line" text="type-global"/>. Note that the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph are <m>x = 7</m> and <m>x = -1</m>, and the parabola is symmetric about the vertical line halfway between the intercepts, at <m>x = 3</m>.
</p><p>
	We can also solve <m>x^2 - 6x - 7 = 0</m> by factoring instead of completing the square. Of course, we get the same solutions by either method. In Example 2, we will solve an equation that cannot be solved by factoring.

<example xml:id="example-completing-the-square2">
	<p>
		Solve <m>x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0</m> by completing the square.

<ol label="1">
	<li>
		Write the equation with the constant term on the right side.
		<me>x^2 - 4x{}\text{______}{}=3</me>
	</li>
	<li>
		Now complete the square on the left side. The coefficient of <m>x</m> is <m>-4</m>, so
		<me>p = \frac{1}{2}(-4) = -2 ~~~\text{ and } ~~~ p^2 = (-2)^2 = 4</me>
		We add <m>4</m> to both sides of our equation:
		<me>x^2 - 4x  \alert{{}+4}=3\alert{{}+4}</me>
	</li>
	<li>
		Write the left side as the square of a binomial, and combine terms on the right side:
		<me>(x - 2)^2 =7</me>
	</li>
	<li>
		Finally, use extraction of roots to obtain
		\begin{align*}
		x - 2 \amp =\sqrt{7} \amp\text{or}\amp\amp x - 2 \amp= -\sqrt{7}\amp\text{Solve each equation.}\\

<subsection><title>The General Case</title>
<p>
	Our method for completing the square works only if the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is <m>1</m>. If we want to solve a quadratic equation whose lead coefficient is not <m>1</m>, we first divide each term of the equation by the lead coefficient.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-general-quadratic">
	<p>
		Solve <m>2x^2 - 6x - 5 = 0</m>.
	</p>
<solution>
<p><ol label="1">
	<li>
		<p>Because the coefficient of <m>x^2</m> is <m>2</m>, we must divide each term of the equation by <m>2</m>.
		<me>x^2 - 3x - \frac{5}{2}= 0</me>
		Now we proceed as before. Rewrite the equation with the constant on the right side.
		<me>x^2 - 3x \text{______} = \frac{5}{2}</me></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Complete the square:
		<me>p = \frac{1}{2}(-3) = \frac{-3}{2} ~~~\text{ and } ~~~ p^2 = \left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}</me>
		Add <m>\frac{9}{4}</m> to both sides of our equation:
		<me>x^2 - 3x  \alert{{}+\frac{9}{4}}=\frac{5}{2}\alert{{}+\frac{9}{4}}</me></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Rewrite the left side as the square of a binomial and simplify the right side to get
		<me>\left(x - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 =\frac{19}{4}</me></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Finally, extract roots and solve each equation for <m>x</m>.
		<me>
		x - \frac{3}{2}  =\sqrt{\frac{19}{4}} ~~~\text{ or }~~~ x - \frac{3}{2} = -\sqrt{\frac{19}{4}} 
		</me>
		The solutions are <m>\dfrac{3}{2}+\sqrt{\dfrac{19}{4}}</m> and <m>\dfrac{3}{2}-\sqrt{\dfrac{19}{4}}</m>. Using a calculator, we can find decimal approximations for the solutions: <m>3.679</m> and <m>-0.679</m>.</p>
	</li>
</ol></p>
</solution></example>

<warning><statement>
	<p>
		In <xref ref="example-completing-the-square2" text="type-global"/>, it is essential that we first divide each term of the equation by <m>2</m>, the coefficient of <m>x^2</m>. The following attempt at a solution is <em>incorrect</em>.
		\begin{align*}

		2x^2 - 6x + 9 \amp= 5 + 9\\
		(2x - 3)^2 \amp= 14 ~~~ \rightarrow ~~~ \text{ Incorrect!}
		\end{align*}
		You can check that <m>(2x - 3)^2</m> is not equal to <m>2x^2 - 6x + 9</m>. We have not written the left side of the equation as a perfect square, so the solutions we obtain by extracting roots will not be correct.

	Here is a summary of the steps for solving quadratic equations by completing the square
</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-solve-quadratic-by-completing-square.xml" />

</subsection>




<subsection><title>Quadratic Formula</title>
<p>
	Instead of completing the square every time we solve a new quadratic equation, we can complete the square on the general quadratic equation,
	<me>ax^2 + bx + c = 0\text{, }~~~ a \ne 0</me>
	and obtain a formula for the solutions of any quadratic equation.
</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-quadratic-formula.xml" />

<p>
	This formula expresses the solutions of a quadratic equation in terms of its coefficients. (The proof of the formula is considered in the Homework problems.) The symbol <m>\pm</m>, read plus or minus, is used to combine the two equations
	<me>x =\dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ~~~~ \text{and} ~~~~x =\dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}</me> 
	into a single equation.
</p>
<p>
	To solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, all we have to do is substitute the coefficients <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> into the formula.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-quadratic-formula">
	<p>
		Solve <m>2x^2 + 1 = 4x</m>.
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		Write the equation in standard form as
		<me>2x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0</me>
		Substitute <m>\alert{2}</m> for <m>a</m>, <m>\alert{-4}</m> for <m>b</m>, and <m>\alert{1}</m> for <m>c</m> into the quadratic formula, then simplify.
		\begin{align*}
		x \amp =\frac{-(\alert{-4})\pm \sqrt{(\alert{-4})^2 - 4(\alert{2})(\alert{1})}}{2(\alert{2})} \\
		\amp = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{8}}{4}
		\end{align*}
		Using a calculator, we find that the solutions are approximately <m>1.707</m> and <m>0.293</m>. (If you would like to review following the order of operations on a calculator, please see Appendix B.)</p>
		<p> We can also verify that the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph of <m>y = 2x^2 - 4x + 1</m> are approximately <m>1.707</m> and <m>0.293</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-parabola-intercepts" text="type-global"/>.

<subsection><title>Applications</title>
<p>
	We have now seen four different algebraic methods for solving quadratic equations:
	<ol>
		<li>
			Factoring
		</li>
		<li>
			Extraction of roots
		</li>
		<li>
			Completing the square
		</li>
		<li>
			Quadratic formula
		</li>
	</ol>
	Factoring and extraction of roots are relatively fast and simple, but they do not work on all quadratic equations. The quadratic formula will work on any quadratic equation.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-fencing-areas">
	<p>
		The owners of a day-care center plan to enclose a divided play area against the back wall of their building, as shown in <xref ref="fig-fencing-areas" text="type-global"/>. They have <m>300</m> feet of picket fence and would like the total area of the playground to be <m>6000</m> square feet. Can they enclose the playground with the fence they have, and if so, what should the dimensions of the playground be?
		<figure xml:id="fig-fencing-areas"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-fencing-areas"  width="30%"><description>two fenced rectangles against wall</description></image> </figure>
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		Suppose the width of the play area is <m>x</m> feet. Because there are three sections of fence along the width of the play area, that leaves <m>300 - 3x</m> feet of fence for its length. The area of the play area should be <m>6000</m> square feet, so we have the equation
		<me>x(300 - 3x) = 6000</me>
		This is a quadratic equation. In standard form,
		\begin{align*}
		3x^2 - 300x + 6000 \amp= 0\amp\amp\text{Divide each term by 3.}\\
		x^2 - 100x + 2000 \amp= 0
		\end{align*} 
		The left side cannot be factored, so we use the quadratic formula with <m>a = \alert{1}</m>, <m>b = \alert{-100}</m>, and <m>c = \alert{2000}</m>.
		\begin{align*}
		x \amp=\frac{-(\alert{-100}) \pm\sqrt{(\alert{-100})^2 - 4(\alert{1})(\alert{2000})}}{2(\alert{1})}\\
		\amp= \frac{100 \pm\sqrt{2000}}{2}\approx \frac{100 \pm 44.7}{2}
		\end{align*}
		Simplifying the last fraction, we find that <m>x \approx 72.35</m> or <m>x\approx 27.65</m>. Both values give solutions to the problem.
		<ul>
		<li> If the width of the play area is <m>72.35</m> feet, then the length is <m>300 - 3(72.35)</m>, or <m>82.95</m> feet.</li>
		<li> If the width is <m>27.65</m> feet, the length is <m>300 - 3(27.65)</m>, or <m>217.05</m> feet.</li>
	</ul>

	Sometimes it is useful to solve a quadratic equation for one variable in terms of the others.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-quadratic-in-two-variables">
	<p>
		Solve <m>x^2 - xy + y = 2</m> for <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m>.
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		We first write the equation in standard form as a quadratic equation in the variable <m>x</m>.
		<me>x^2 - yx + (y - 2) = 0</me>
		Expressions in <m>y</m> are treated as constants with respect to <m>x</m>, so that <m>a = \alert{1}</m>, <m>b = \alert{-y}</m>, and <m>c = \alert{y - 2}</m>. Substitute these expressions into the quadratic formula.
		\begin{align*}
		x \amp=\frac{-(\alert{-y}) \pm\sqrt{(\alert{-y})^2 - 4(\alert{1})(\alert{y - 2})}}{2(\alert{1})}\\
		\amp = \frac{y \pm\sqrt{y^2 - 4y + 8}}{2}
		\end{align*}
	</p>
</solution>
</example>

<exercise xml:id="exercise-quadratic-in-two-variables"><statement>
	<p>
		Solve <m>2x^2 + kx + k^2 = 1</m> for <m>x</m> in terms of <m>k</m>.
	</p>
</statement>
<answer><p><m>x=\frac{-k\pm\sqrt{8-7k^2}}{4} </m></p></answer>
