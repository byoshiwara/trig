    <title>To Solve a Quadratic Inequality Algebraically:</title>
    <p>
		<ol label="*1*">
			<li><p>
				Write the inequality in standard form: One side is <m>0</m>, and the other has the form <m>ax^2 + bx + c</m>.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>
				Find the <m>x</m>-intercepts of the graph of <m>y = ax^2 + bx + c</m> by setting <m>y = 0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Make a rough sketch of the graph, using the sign of <m>a</m> to determine whether the parabola opens upward or downward.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Decide which intervals on the <m>x</m>-axis give the correct sign for <m>y</m>.
