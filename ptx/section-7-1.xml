<title>Polynomial Functions</title>
<introduction>
<p>
	We have already encountered some examples of polynomial functions. Linear functions,
	<me>f (x) = ax + b</me>
	and quadratic functions
	<me>f (x) = ax^2 + bx + c</me>
	are special cases of polynomial functions. In general, we make the following definition.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Polynomial Function</title>
<p>
	A <term>polynomial function</term><idx>polynomial function</idx> has the form
	<me>f (x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0</me>
	where <m>a_0</m>, <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>, <m>a_n</m> are constants and <m>a_n \ne 0</m>. The coefficient <m>a_n</m> of the highest power term is called the <term>lead coefficient</term><idx>lead coefficient</idx>.
</p></assemblage>

<p>
	Some examples of polynomials are
	<md>
		<mrow>
			f(x)\amp= 6x^3 - 4x^2 + x - 2 \amp g(x) \amp= 9x^5 - 2
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			p(x) \amp = x^4 + x^2 + 1 \amp q(x) \amp= 2x^{10} - x^7 + 3x^6 + 5x^3 + 3x
		</mrow>
	</md>
</p>
<p>
	Each of the polynomials above is written in <term>descending powers</term><idx>descending powers</idx>, which means that the highest-degree term comes first, and the degrees of the terms decrease from largest to smallest. Sometimes it is useful to write a polynomial in <term>ascending powers</term><idx>ascending powers</idx>, so that the degrees of the terms increase. For example, the polynomial <m>f(x)</m> above would be written as
	<me>
		f(x) = -2 + x - 4x^2 + 6x^3
	</me>
	in ascending powers.
</p>
</introduction>

<subsection><title>Products of Polynomials</title>
<p>
	When we multiply two or more polynomials together, we get another polynomial of higher degree. (See Algebra Skills Refresher A.7 for the definition of degree.)
</p>

	</p>
</statement>
<answer><p><m>y^3 - y + 6</m></p></answer>
</exercise>

<p>
	In <xref ref="example-polynomial-product" text="type-global"/>a, we multiplied a polynomial of degree 1 by a polynomial of degree 3, and the product was a polynomial of degree 4. In <xref ref="example-polynomial-product" text="type-global"/>b, the product of three first degree polynomials is a third-degree polynomial.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Degree of a Product</title>
<p>
	The degree of a product of nonzero polynomials is the sum of the degrees of the factors. That is,
</p>
<p>
If <m>P(x)</m> has degree <m>m</m> and <m>Q(x)</m> has degree <m>n</m>, then their product
<m>P(x)Q(x)</m> has degree <m>n + m</m>.
</p>
</assemblage>

<example><p>
	Let <m>P(x) = 5x^4 - 2x^3 + 6x^2 - x + 2</m>, and <m>Q(x) = 3x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 3</m>.
	<ol label="a">
		<li>
			<p>What is the degree of their product? What is the coefficient of the lead term?</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>
			Find the coefficient of the <m>x^3</m>-term of the product.
		</p></li>
	</ol>
</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		<ol label="a">
			<li><p>
				The degree of <m>P</m> is <m>4</m>, and the degree of <m>Q</m> is <m>3</m>, so the degree of their product is <m>4 + 3 = 7</m>. The only degree <m>7</m> term of the product is <m>(5x^4)(3x^3) = 15x^7</m>, which has coefficient <m>15</m>.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				In the product, each term of <m>P(x)</m> is multiplied by each term of <m>Q(x)</m>. We get degree <m>3</m> terms by multiplying together terms of degree <m>0</m> and <m>3</m>, or <m>1</m> and <m>2</m>. For these polynomials, the possible combinations are:</p><p>

<subsection><title>Special Products</title>

<p>
	In the Algebra Skills Refresher <xref ref="appendix-Factoring-Quadratic-Trinomials" text="type-global"/>, you can review the following special products involving quadratic expressions.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Special Products of Binomials</title>
<p>
	<md>
		<mrow>
			\amp(a + b)^2 = (a + b) (a + b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			\amp(a - b)^2 = (a - b) (a - b) = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			\amp(a + b) (a - b)= a^2 -b^2
		</mrow>
	</md>
</p>
</assemblage>

<p>
	There are also special products resulting in cubic polynomials. In the Homework problems, you will be asked to verify the following products.
</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-cube-of-binomial.xml" />

<p>
	If you become familiar with these general forms, you can use them as patterns to find specific examples of such products.
</p>


<example xml:id="example-cube-binomial">
	<p>
		Write <m>(2w - 3)^3</m> as a polynomial.
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		Use <xref ref="cube-of-x-minus-y">product</xref> above, with <m>x</m> replaced by <m>\alert{2w}</m> and <m>y</m> replaced by <m>\blert{3}</m>.
		<md>
			<mrow>
				(x - y)^3 \amp= x^3 - 3 x^2 y + 3 x y^2 - y^3
			</mrow>
			<mrow>
				(\alert{2w} - \blert{3})^3 \amp= (\alert{2w})^3 - 3(\alert{2w})^2(\blert{3}) + 3(\alert{2w})(\blert{3})^2 - \blert{3}^3 \amp\amp\text{Simplify.}
			</mrow>
			<mrow>
				\amp= 8w^3 - 36w^2 + 54w - 27
			</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>
</solution></example>

<p>
	Of course, we can also expand the product in <xref ref="example-cube-binomial" text="type-global"/> simply by polynomial multiplication and arrive at the same answer.
</p>

<exercise><statement>
	<p>
		Write <m>\left(5 + x^2\right)^3</m> as a polynomial.
	</p>
</statement>
<answer><p><m>125 + 75x^2 + 15x^4 + x^6</m></p></answer>
</exercise>

</subsection>



<subsection><title>Factoring Cubics</title>
<p>
	Another pair of products is useful for factoring cubic polynomials. In the Homework problems, you will be asked to verify the following products:
	<md>
		<mrow>
			(x + y)(x^2 - xy + y^2) \amp= x^3 + y^3
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			(x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) \amp= x^3 - y^3
		</mrow>
	</md>
</p>

<p>
	Viewing these products from right to left, we have the following special factorizations for the sum and difference of two cubes.
</p>

<xi:include href="./assemblage-factoring-sum-of-cubes.xml" />

<p>
	When we recognize a polynomial as a sum or difference of two perfect cubes, we then identify the two cubed expressions and apply the formula.
</p>

<subsection><title>Modeling with Polynomials</title>
<p>
	Polynomials model many variable relationships, including volume and surface area.
</p>

<example>

<p>
	Cubic polynomials are often used in economics to model cost functions. The cost of producing <m>x</m> items is an increasing function of <m>x</m>, but its rate of increase is usually not constant.
</p>

<example xml:id="example-cubic-cost-function">
	<p>
		Pegasus Printing, Ltd. is launching a new magazine. The cost of printing <m>x</m> thousand copies is given by
		<me>
			C(x) = x^3 - 24x^2 + 195x + 250
		</me>
		<ol label="a">
			<li><p>
				What are the <term>fixed costs</term>, that is, the costs incurred before any copies are printed?
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Graph the cost function in the window below and describe the graph.
				<md>
					<mrow>
						\text{Xmin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Xmax} = 20
					</mrow>
					<mrow>
						\text{Ymin} \amp = 0 \amp\amp \text{Ymax} = 1500
					</mrow>
				</md>
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				How many copies can be printed for $1200?
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				What does the concavity of the graph tell you about the cost function?
			</p></li>
		</ol>
	</p>
<solution>
	<p>
		<ol label="a">
			<li><p>
				Fixed costs are given by <m>C(0) = 250</m>, or <m>\$250</m>. The fixed costs include expenses like utility bills that must be paid even if no magazines are produced.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				The graph is shown in <xref ref="fig-GC-cubic-cost-function" text="type-global"/>a. It is increasing from a vertical intercept of <m>250</m>. The graph is concave down for <m>x \lt 8</m> approximately, and concave up for <m>x\gt 8</m>.
				<figure xml:id="fig-GC-cubic-cost-function"><caption></caption><image source="images/fig-GC-cubic-cost-function.jpg"  width="90%"><description>GC graphs of a cubic cost function</description></image></figure>
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				We must solve the equation
				<me>x^3 - 24x^2 + 195x + 250 = 1200</me>
				We will solve the equation graphically, as shown in <xref ref="fig-GC-cubic-cost-function" text="type-global"/>b. Graph <m>y = 1200</m> along with the cost function, and use the <em>intersect</em> command to find the intersection point of the graphs, <m>(15.319, 1200)</m>. <m>C(x) = 1200</m> when <m>x</m> is about <m>15.319</m>, so <m>15,319</m> copies can be printed for <m>\$1200</m>.
			</p></li>
			<li><p>
				Although the cost is always increasing, it increases very slowly from about <m>x = 5</m> to about <m>x = 11</m>. The flattening of the graph in this interval is a result of economy of scale: By buying supplies in bulk and using time efficiently, the cost per magazine can be minimized. However, if the production level is too large, costs begin to rise rapidly again.
			</p></li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</solution></example>

<p>
	In <xref ref="example-cubic-cost-function" text="type-global"/>c, we solved a cubic equation graphically. There is a cubic formula, analogous to the quadratic formula, that allows us to solve cubic equations algebraically, but it is complicated and not often used. See the Projects for Chapter 7 if you would like to know more about the cubic formula.

	Cubic polynomials are also used to model smooth curves connecting given points. Such a curve is called a <term>cubic spline</term>.
