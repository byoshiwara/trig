  "body": " We have tried to make this edition of Trigonometry useful to students in a variety of programs. For example, students who have encountered elements of triangle trig in previous courses may be able to skip all or part of Chapters 1 through 3. Students preparing for technical courses may not need much of the material after Chapter 6 or 7. Chapters 9 and 10 cover vectors and polar coordinates, optional topics that occur in some trigonometry courses but are often reserved for precalculus.  There are many reasons why students might find trigonometry difficult, among them:  The subject inherently involves a great deal of technical detail, which can be allowed to obscure the main ideas.  The subject is often taught with the analytical rigor appropriate to a precalculus course -- before students have acquired the necessary facility with functions.  In his beautiful book, Trigonometric Delights , Eli Maor enjoins us \"Let's not forget that trigonometry is, first and foremost, a practical discipline, born out of and deeply rooted in applications.\" After the New Math \"[f]ormal definitions and legalistic verbosity—all in the name of mathematical rigor—replaced a real understanding of the subject.\" And formalism is \"... certainly not the best way to motivate the beginning student.\"  The typical trigonometry student has just completed a second course in algebra. He or she has a nodding acquaintance with functions and is still very wary of irrational numbers. A statement such as \" \" may well be greeted with panic and bewilderment. So we do not begin with a preliminary chapter covering all the mathematical topics needed for the rest of the course, including elements of analytic geometry and properties of functions such as domain and range, symmetry, transformations, composition, and inverse functions. (This material usually comprises most of a precalculus course, which is usually taught after trigonometry, where it is introduced using more familiar, hence easier, functions as examples.)  Nor do we begin with a chapter about angles, including coterminal and reference angles, converting degrees to minutes and seconds, radians, arc length, and angular velocity, before the trig ratios are even mentioned. We have tried to address these issues as follows:  Chapter 1 reviews only the most basic facts about triangles and circles that students will need to begin their study of trigonometry, and may be omitted or assigned as homework. Other facts about functions and angles are introduced when they are needed. For example, minutes and seconds are discussed in the context of parallax in the section on Law of Sines in Chapter 3. Nautical bearings occur in Section 4.1, Angles and Rotation.  Chapter 2 introduces the three (not six) basic trig ratios, and considers angles in the first quadrant only. We believe this initial simplicity allows students to focus on the fundamental concepts without simultaneously trying to master a welter of peripheral detail.  In Chapter 3 we introduce reference angles for the second quadrant in order to study obtuse triangles and the Laws of Sines and Cosines. Reference angles are covered again in more generality in Chapter 4.  Chapter 4 considers angles as rotations in preparation for the graphs of sine and cosine. Note that the applications of periodic functions in this chapter are functions of degrees only, to fit with our approach: radians come later, after students have some experience with sinusoidal graphs.  Chapter 5 begins with a section on algebraic manipulations with trig ratios, a skill that is often neglected but can engender endless confusion for students. This chapter treats only simple equations and identities; more equations and identities appear in Chapters 7 and 8. We solve equations both graphically and analytically, and we use graphs as well as algebra to verify trigonometric identities.  Chapter 6 introduces radians and the circular functions of real numbers. Most of this chapter and Chapter 7 revisit basic skills such as analyzing graphs and solving equations, but working now in radians rather than degrees.  Chapter 8 studies identities and their use in more detail, including the sum and difference formulas and the double angle identities. Inverse trig functions are included here, and are the three reciprocal trig functions.  Chapters 9 and 10 cover ancillary topics; typical trigonometry courses may include one or more of these topics: vectors, polar coordinates, and complex numbers.  In addition to the Homework Problems, each Example in the book is followed by a similar Exercise for students to test their understanding. Each Section concludes with a Summary , a set of Study Questions, and a list of Skills to be addressed in the Homework. A Summary and a set of Review Problems follows each chapter. Chapters 1 through 8 include Activities for students to work through some of the main ideas. We have described the use of a graphing calculator, but other graphing utilities can easily be substituted.  Throughout we have been guided by the Rule of Four and use tables and graphical representation to illustrate concepts. We have taken care to include numerical examples and diagrams, both in Examples and in Homework Problems, to offer students some intuitive understanding for the more abstract ideas of trigonometry. Above all, we have tried to focus on the fundamental ideas of trigonometry by introducing them in their most basic form and returning later to look at them in greater detail.

There are four pairs of vertical angles, and four pairs of corresponding angles corresponding angles angle corresponding angle corresponding corresponding angles , or angles in the same position relative to the transversal on each of the parallel lines.   For example, the angles labeled 1 and 5 are corresponding angles, as are the angles labeled 4 and 8. Finally, angles 3 and 6 are called alternate interior angles alternate interior angles angle alternate interior angle alternate interior alternate interior angles , and so are angles 4 and 5.   transversal   Paralles lines cut by a transversal  6. If parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, the alternate interior angles are equal. Corresponding angles are also equal.     The parallelogram shown at right is formed by the intersection of two sets of parallel lines. Show that the opposite angles of the parallelogram are equal.    parallelogram   Angles 1 and 2 are equal because they are alternate interior angles, and angles 2 and 3 are equal because they are corresponding angles. Therefore angles 1 and 3, the opposite angles of the parallelogram, are equal. Similarly, you can show that angles 4, 5, and 6 are equal.   Show that the adjacent angles of a parallelogram are supplementary. (You can use angles 1 and 4 in the parallelogram of the previous example.) Note that angles 2 and 6 are supplementary because they form a straight angle. Angle 1 equals angle 2 because they are alternate interior angles, and similarly angle 4 equals angle 5. Angle 5 equals angle 6 because they are corresponding angles. Thus, angle 4 equals angle 6, and angle 1 equals angle 2. So angles 4 and 1 are supplementary because 2 and 6 are.

Show that the altitude of an equilateral triangle divides it into two congruent right triangles.    equil triangle with altitude   Consider for example an equilateral triangle of side 8 inches, as shown above. The altitude is perpendicular to the base, so each half of the original triangle is a right triangle. Because each right triangle contains a angle, the remaining angle in each triangle must be . Both triangles have a side of length 8 between the angles of 30° and 60°, so they are congruent. (Consequently, the short sides of the congruent triangles are equal, so each is half the original base.)  The triangles in the previous example are a special type of right triangle called triangles.

The ratios of corresponding sides are not equal: the ratio of the longest sides is , but the ratio of the smallest sides is . The triangles are not similar.

Thus, we need only show that two pairs of angles are equal to show that two triangles are similar.   Using Proportions with Similar Triangles  similar triangles proportions  The figure in the next example shows a parallelogram and two triangles, and . Can we find the unknown lengths and in the larger triangle?  First note that two pairs of corresponding angles in the triangles are equal: and are vertical angles, and and are alternate interior angles. But if two pairs of corresponding angles are equal, then the third pair must be equal also. This means that the two triangles are similar, and we can use the fact that their corresponding sides are proportional to find and .   Find the value of in the figure at right.    parallelogram triangles    We see that is the length of the shortest side in . We know the short side in and the lengths of the medium sides in each triangle. If we form the ratios of the short sides and the medium sides, we obtain the following proportion.

Find the value of in the previous example.    Similar Right Triangles  similar triangles right triangles  right triangle similar  If two right triangles have one pair of corresponding acute angles with the same measure, then the triangles are similar. We can use this fact about right triangles to make indirect measurements.   Delbert would like to know the height of a certain building. He gets Francine to hold up a 5-foot pole near the building and measures the length of its shadow. The shadow of the pole is 3 feet long, and the shadow of the building is 12 feet long.   building   Use similar triangles to write a proportion involving the height of the building.  Solve the proportion to find the height of the building.    In the figure above we see two right triangles: One triangle is formed by the building and its shadow, and the other by the pole and its shadow. Because the light rays from the sun are parallel, the two angles at the tips of the shadows are equal. Thus, the two right triangles are similar, and their corresponding sides are proportional. The ratios of heights and bases in the two triangles yield the proportion  To solve the proportion, we cross-multiply to get The building is 20 feet tall.    Earlier we created a 30°-60°-90° triangle in which the shorter leg was 4 inches and the hypotenuse was 8 inches. The hypotenuse of another 30°-60°-90° triangle is 5 feet. What is the length of the side opposite the 30° angle?  2.5 feet   Overlapping Triangles  triangle overlapping  In some applications, similar triangles may share a side or an angle.   Identify two similar triangles in the figure at right, and write a proportion to find .  overlapping triangles   The two triangles overlap, sharing the marked angle, as shown below. Because each triangle also has a right angle, they are similar.    separated triangles   Note that the base of the larger triangle is . The ratio of the heights and the ratio of the bases must be equal, so we write the following proportion.    Heather wants to know the height of a street lamp.

Delbert walks from point down the bank a short distance to point and sights the tree. He measures the angle between his line of sight and the streambank.   Draw a figure showing the stream, the tree, and right triangle .  Meanwhile Francine, who was still standing at point , walks away from the stream at right-angles to Delbert's path. Delbert watches her progress, and tells her to stop at point when the angle between the stream bank and his line of sight to Francine is the same as the angle from the stream bank to the tree. Add triangle to your figure.  Delbert now measures the distance from point to Francine at point . Explain why this distance is the same as the distance across the stream.  river so   If you have a baseball cap, here is another way to measure the distance across a river. Stand at point directly across the river from a convenient landmark, say a large rock, on the other side. Tilt your head down so that the brim of the cap points directly at the base of the rock, .   Draw a figure showing the river, the rock, and right triangle , where is the location of your baseball cap on your head.  Now, without changing the angle of your head, rotate and sight along the bank on your side of the river. Have a friend mark the spot on the ground where the brim of your cap points. Add triangle to your figure.  Finally, you can measure the distance from point to point . Explain why this distance is the same as the distance across the river.

The angles 1 and 2 formed by the light rays are equal, as shown in the figure. She then measures the distance to the mirror (2 feet) and the distance from the mirror to the base of the cliff (56 feet). If she is 5 feet 6 inches tall, how high is the cliff?  cliff 154 feet  Edo estimates the height of the Washington Monument as follows. He notices that he can see the reflection of the top of the monument in the reflecting pool. He is feet from the tip of the reflection, and that point is 1080 yards from the base of the monument, as shown below. From his physics class Edo knows that the angles marked and are equal. If Edo is 6 feet tall, what is his estimate for the height of the Washington Monument?   Wash mon  In the sixth century BC, the Greek philosopher and mathematician Thales used similar triangles to measure the distance to a ship at sea. Two observers on the shore at points and would sight the ship and measure the angles formed, as shown in figure (a).

SM mountains   Each interval on the map represents one kilometer. Delbert remembers the Pythagorean theorem , and uses the map coordinates to label the sides of a right triangle. The distance he wants is the hypotenuse of the triangle, so   The straight-line distance to Coyote junction is about 5 kilometers.  The formula for the distance between two points is obtained in the same way.  We first label a right triangle with points and on opposite ends of the hypotenuse. (See the figure at right.) The sides of the triangle have lengths and .

Rational Number  Any number (including fractions) that can be written as a quotient of two integers is called a rational number rational number .  The decimal form of a rational number is either a terminating decimal terminating decimal rational number terminating decimal , such as , or a repeating decimal repeating decimal rational number repeating decimal , such as . Thus, we can always write down an exact decimal equivalent for a rational number, although we may choose to round off a particularly long or unwieldy decimal. For example,  Note that is not exactly equal to ; it is an approximation for , just as is an approximation for . In our work, it will be important to distinguish between exact values and approximations.  Irrational Number  An irrational number irrational number is one that cannot be written as a quotient of two integers ,where .  Examples of irrational numbers are , , and . The decimal form of an irrational number is nonterminating and nonrepeating. The first few digits of the examples mentioned are  but none of these decimal forms ever ends. Thus, we cannot write down an exact decimal equivalent for an irrational number . The best we can do is give a decimal approximation, no matter how many digits we include.   Which values are exact, and which are approximations?           Because is a rational number, it has an exact decimal equivalent. Divide 7 by 32 to see that .  Because 8 is not a perfect square, is irrational, so is not the exact value of .  , so this value is exact.  Because is an irrational number, it has no decimal equivalent, so is an approximation.     For which numbers can you give an exact decimal equivalent?        b, d   Circumference and Area  circumference  Recall from geometry that the circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius.  Circumference of a Circle  circumference  The circumference of a circle of radius is given by   The number gives the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter. It is an irrational number, .  The length of a portion, or arc, of a circle, is called its arclength arclength .  Francine baked an apple pie with diameter 8 inches. If Delbert cuts himself a 60° wedge, what is the arclength of the curved edge?  The radius of the pie is 4 inches, so its circumference is inches.  A 60° wedge, shown at right, is of the entire pie, so its edge is of the circumference. The exact length of the arc is thus   pie  Using a calculator, we find that rounded to two decimal places, so the length of the curved edge is between 4 and 4 inches.    What is the arclength of the curved edge of a 60° wedge cut from a blueberry pie of diameter 10 inches?   The area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius.  Area of a Circle  circle area  area of circle  The area of a circle of radius is given by   A portion of a circle shaped like a pie-shaped wedge is called a sector sector .  What is the area of Delbert's slice of apple pie in the previous example?  As we saw in the previous example, Delbert's sector of the pie is of the entire pie, so its area of the area of the whole pie, or  The area of the wedge is , or about 8.34 square inches.

  "body": " Chapter 1 Summary and Review  Key Concepts   The sum of the angles in a triangle is .  A right triangle has one angle of .  All of the angles of an equilateral triangle are equal.  The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.  Vertical angles are equal.  If parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, the alternate interior angles are equal. Corresponding angles are also equal.  Two triangles are congruent if they have exactly the same size and shape.  The altitude of an equilateral triangle divides it into two congruent right triangles.  In a right triangle, the leg opposite the angle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  Two triangles are similar if they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. The corresponding angles are equal, and the corresponding sides are proportional .  Similar Triangles  Two triangles are similar if either  their corresponding angles are equal, or  their corresponding sides are proportional.    If two right triangles have one pair of corresponding acute angles with the same measure, then the triangles are similar.  Distance Formula  The distance between two points and is  Any number that can be written as a quotient of two integers , is called a rational number . The decimal form of a rational number is either a terminating decimal or a repeating decimal .  An irrational number is one that cannot be written as a quotient of two integers . We cannot write down an exact decimal equivalent for an irrational number.  A circle is the set of all points in a plane that lie at a given distance, called the radius , from a fixed point called the center .  Circle  The equation for a circle of radius centered at the origin is  The circle , which is centered at the origin and has radius 1 unit, is called the unit circle .

  "body": " Side and Angle Relationships  Introduction  From geometry we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. Are there any relationships between the angles of a triangle and its sides?  First of all, you have probably observed that the longest side in a triangle is always opposite the largest angle, and the shortest side is opposite the smallest angle, as illustrated below.   triangle sides  triangle angles  It is usual to label the angles of a triangle with capital letters, and the side opposite each angle with the corresponding lower-case letter, as shown at right. We will follow this practice unless indicated otherwise.  triangle notation  In and is obtuse. Side is 6 feet long. What can you conclude about the other sides?  Because is greater than , we know that is greater than , so is less than  Thus, and consequently .  We can conclude that feet long, and feet long.   In isosceles triangle , the vertex angle . Which side is longer, or ?  is longer   The Triangle Inequality  triangle inequality  It is also true that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side, or else the two sides will not meet to form a triangle. This fact is called the triangle inequality.  Triangle Inequality  triangle inequality  triangle inequality   In any triangle, we must have that where are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.  triangle   We cannot use the triangle inequality to find the exact lengths of the sides of a triangle, but we can find largest and smallest possible values for the length.  Two sides of a triangle have lengths 7 inches and 10 inches, as shown at right. What can you say about the length of the third side?  triangle  We let represent the length of the third side of the triangle. By looking at each side in turn, we can apply the triangle inequality three different ways, to get We solve solve inequality each of these inequalities to find We already know that because must be positive, but the other two inequalities do give us new information. The third side must be greater than 3 inches but less than 17 inches long.   Can you make a triangle with three wooden sticks of lengths 14 feet, 26 feet, and 10 feet? Sketch a picture, and explain why or why not. No, is not greater than 26.   Right Triangles: The Pythagorean Theorem  right triangle Pythagorean theorem  Pythagorean theorem  hypotenuse  leg  In Chapter 1 we used the Pythagorean theorem to derive the distance formula. We can also use the Pythagorean theorem to find one side of a right triangle if we know the other two sides.  Pythagorean Theorem  In a right triangle, if stands for the length of the hypotenuse, and the lengths of the two legs are denoted by and , then   right triangle    A 25-foot ladder is placed against a wall so that its foot is 7 feet from the base of the wall. How far up the wall does the ladder reach?  We make a sketch of the situation, as shown below, and label any known dimensions. We'll call the unknown height .  The ladder forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem, substituting 25 for , 7 for , and for . Now solve by extraction of roots:  ladder  The height must be a positive number, so the solution does not make sense for this problem. The ladder reaches 24 feet up the wall.   A baseball diamond is a square whose sides are 90 feet long. The catcher at home plate sees a runner on first trying to steal second base, and throws the ball to the second-baseman. Find the straight-line distance from home plate to second base.  feet  Keep in mind that the Pythagorean theorem is true only for right triangles, so the converse Pythagorean theorem converse of the theorem is also true. In other words, if the sides of a triangle satisfy the relationship , then the triangle must be a right triangle. We can use this fact to test whether or not a given triangle has a right angle.  Delbert is paving a patio in his back yard, and would like to know if the corner at is a right angle.  He measures 20 cm along one side from the corner, and 48 cm along the other side, placing pegs and at each position, as shown at right. The line joining those two pegs is 52 cm long. Is the corner a right angle?    patio     If is a right triangle, then its sides must satisfy . We find Yes, because , the corner at is a right angle.    The sides of a triangle measure 15 inches, 25 inches, and 30 inches long. Is the triangle a right triangle?  No  The Pythagorean theorem relates the sides of right triangles. However, for information about the sides of other triangles, the best we can do (without trigonometry!) is the triangle inequality. Nor does the Pythagorean theorem help us find the angles in a triangle. In the next section we discover relationships between the angles and the sides of a right triangle.

By using what we know about similar triangles, we can find the unknown sides of a right triangle if we know only one side and one of the acute angles.   right triangle with one unknown side  right triangle with two unknown sides       The Sine of an Angle  sin  sin sine  sine   In Example 2 of Section 1.2 , we saw that in a 30-60-90 right triangle, the ratio of the shortest side to the hypotenuse was , or 0.5. This ratio is the same for any two right triangles with a angle, because they are similar triangles, as shown at right.  triangle  The ratio is given a name; it is called the \"sine of .\" We write where sin is an abbreviation for sine. There is nothing special about angles; we can talk about the sine of any angle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.  Recall that we use the notation to indicate a function of an input variable, . In fact, the sine ratio is a function of the angle, so we use parentheses around the angle input to refer to its sine, like this: .  Sine of an Acute Angle  sine sine of an acute angle     triangle    Find the sine of the labeled angle in each triangle below.   triangle  triangle   The side opposite angle is 5, and the hypotenuse is 13, so the sine of is   The side opposite angle is , and the hypotenuse is 3, so the sine of is    Find the sine of the labeled angle in the triangle at right. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.  triangle   We must use the sides of a right triangle to calculate the sine of an angle. For example, in the triangle at right, , because is a right triangle.  It is not true that , or . In this chapter, we consider only right triangles.  triangle   Using a Calculator  Mathematicians have calculated the sines of any angle we like. The values of the sine were originally collected into tables, and are now available on scientific calculators. For example, let's find the sine of . First, consider some triangles, as shown below.  triangle   Do you expect the sine of to be larger or smaller than the sine of ? Do you expect the sine of to be larger or smaller than 1?  Use your calculator to find the sine of by entering SIN  . (Make sure your calculator is set for degrees.) You should find that This is not an exact value; the sine of is an irrational number, and your calculator shows as many digits as its display will allow. (Not all sine values are as “nice” as the sine of !) Usually we round to four decimal places, so we write   Note that when you press the sine key, SIN , your calculator displays with an open parenthesis, as the prompt to enter an angle, because the sine is a function of the angle.  You can think of the notation sin as an operation symbol telling you to find the sine of an angle, just as the symbol tells you to take the square root of the expression under the radical.    Use your calculator to complete the table, rounding your answers to four decimal places.                            What do you notice about the values of as increases from to ? If you plot the values of against the values of , will the graph be a straight line? Why or why not?                            The values of increase from 0 to 1 as increases from to . The graph will not be a straight line because the slopes between successive points are not constant.  The important thing to remember is that the sine of an angle, say , is the same for any right triangle with a angle, no matter what the size or orientation of the triangle.  The figure below shows three different right triangles with a angle. Although the sides of the triangle may be bigger or smaller, the ratio  is always the same for that angle, because the triangles are similar. This is why the sine ratio sine ratio sine ratio sine is useful.  triangles      Using the Sine Ratio to Find an Unknown Side  sine ratio  sine using to find an unknown side  In the next example we see how to use the sine ratio to find an unknown side in a right triangle, knowing only one other side and one angle.  Find the length of the side opposite the angle in the triangle shown.  triangle  In this triangle, the ratio is equal to the sine of , or We use a calculator to find an approximate value for the sine of , filling in the lengths of the hypotenuse and the opposite side to get We solve for to find To two decimal places, the length of the opposite side is 13.79 centimeters.   In the previous example, even though we showed only four places in , you should not round off intermediate steps in a calculation, because the answer loses accuracy with each rounding. You can use the following keystrokes on your calculator to avoid entering a long approximation for : The calculator returns  Find the length of the hypotenuse in the triangle shown.  triangle 8.5 m   The Cosine and the Tangent  cosine  tangent  cosine ratio  tangent ratio  There are two more trigonometric ratios used for calculating the sides of right triangles, depending on which of the three sides is known and which are unknown. These ratios are called the cosine and the tangent .  Suppose we'd like to find the height of a tall cliff without actually climbing it. We can measure the distance to the base of the cliff, and we can use a surveying tool called a theodolite to measure the angle between the ground and our line of sight to the top of the cliff (this is called the angle of elevation ).  These values give us two parts of a right triangle, as shown at right. The height we want is the side opposite the angle of elevation. The distance to the base of the cliff is the length of the side adjacent to the angle of elevation.  triangle  The ratio of the side opposite an angle to the side adjacent to the angle is called the tangent tangent of the angle. The abbreviation for “tangent of theta” is tan ( ) tan .  Tangent of an Acute Angle  tan  tan tangent  tangent    triangle   Just like the sine of an angle, the tangent ratio is always the same for a given angle, no matter what size triangle it occurs in. And just like , we can find the values of on a scientific calculator.   Use your calculator to find the tangent of .  Find the height of the cliff if the angle of elevation to the top of the cliff is at a distance of 300 feet from the base of the cliff.    Enter TAN (58) to find , rounded to four decimal places.   We use the tangent ratio to write an equation. In this triangle, the angle is .  triangle  Next we fill in the value of , and the lengths of the sides. Solving for gives so the height of the cliff is about 480 feet.   Use the tangent ratio to find in the triangle shown.  triangle  Use the sine ratio to find the hypotenuse, , of the triangle.  Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of the triangle. Do you get the same answer with both methods? Can you explain why the calculations might give (slightly) different answers?   ft  ft  The answers agree when rounded to units. Rounding during calculation can cause the results to differ.  The third trigonometric ratio, called the cosine , is the ratio of the side adjacent to an angle and the hypotenuse of the triangle.  Cosine of an Acute Angle  cos  cos cosine  cosine    triangle     Find , and for the triangle shown at right.  triangle  First, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse, . For the angle , the opposite side is 8 inches long, and the adjacent side is 6 inches long, as shown in the figure. Thus,    Use your calculator to complete the table. Rounding the values of sine and cosine to four decimal places.                                        What do you notice about the values of sine and cosine? Can you explain why this is true? (Hint: If one (non-right) angle of a right triangle measures degrees, how big is the other angle? Now sketch the triangle and label the opposite and adjacent sides for each angle.)                                         The cosine of is equal to the sine of the complement of , or .  In the previous exercise, you should also notice that as the angle increases, increases but decreases.  You can see why this is true in the figure below. In each right triangle, the hypotenuse has the same length. But as the angle increases, the opposite side gets longer and the adjacent side gets shorter.  triangles    The Three Trigonometric Ratios  Here is a summary of the three trigonometric ratios we have discussed.  Trigonometric Ratios  trigonometric ratios  If is one of the angles in a right triangle,    triangle    These three definitions are the foundation for all the rest of trigonometry. You should internalize them immediately!!  We must also be careful to apply these definitions of the trigonometric ratios only to right triangles. In the next example, we create a right triangle by drawing an extra line.  The vertex angle of an isosceles triangle is , and the equal sides are 16 meters long. Find the altitude of the triangle.    The triangle described is not a right triangle. However, the altitude of an isosceles triangle bisects the vertex angle and divides the triangle into two congruent right triangles, as shown in the figure. The 16-meter side becomes the hypotenuse of the right triangle, and the altitude, , of original triangle is the side adjacent to the angle.   triangle  Which of the three trig ratios is helpful in this problem? The cosine is the ratio that relates the hypotenuse and the adjacent side, so we'll begin with the equation We use a calculator to find and fill in the lengths of the sides. Solving for gives The altitude of the triangle is about 15.3 meters long.   Another isosceles triangle has base angles of and equal sides of length 6.8 centimeters.

In a right triangle, we know that one of the angles is . If we know three parts of a right triangle, including one of the sides, we can use trigonometry to find all the other unknown parts. This is called solving solve a triangle the triangle.   The hypotenuse of a right triangle is 150 feet long, and one of the angles is , as shown in the figure. Solve the triangle.  triangle  We can find the side opposite the 35° angle by using the sine ratio. The opposite side is about 86 feet long. To find side we could use the Pythagorean theorem now, but it is better to use given information, rather than values we have calculated, to find the other unknown parts. We will use the cosine ratio. The adjacent side is about 123 feet long. Finally, the unknown angle is the complement of , or .  Sketch a right triangle with   one angle of ,  the side adjacent to that angle of length 5 centimeters.  Without doing the calculations, list the steps you would use to solve the triangle. Use tan to find the opposite side. Use cos to find the hypotenuse. Subtract from to find the third angle.   Finding an Angle  angle find  While watching her niece at the playground, Francine wonders how steep the slide is. She happens to have a tape measure and her calculator with her, and finds that the slide is 77 inches high and covers a horizontal distance of 136 inches, as shown below.   slide  Francine knows that one way to describe the steepness of an incline is to calculate its slope, which in this case is However, Francine would really like to know what angle the slide makes with the horizontal. She realizes that the slope she has just calculated is also the tangent of the angle she wants.  If we know the tangent of an angle, can we find the angle? Yes, we can: locate the key labeled on your calculator; it is probably the second function above the TAN key. Enter  2nd  TAN 0.5662  and you should find that . tan tan inverse trigonometric function This means that is the angle whose tangent is . We read the notation as \" inverse tangent inverse trigonometric function of 0.5662 is 29.52 degrees.\"  When we find tan of a number, we are finding an angle whose tangent is that number. Similarly, sin  sin sin inverse trigonometric function and cos  cos cos inverse trigonometric function are read as “inverse sine” and “inverse cosine.” They find an angle with the given sine or cosine.  Find the angle whose sine is .  Enter 2nd  SIN 0.6834 into your calculator to find So is the angle whose sine is . Or we can say that You can check the last equation on your calculator.  In the last example, the two equations say the same thing in different ways.  The notation does not mean . It is true that we use negative exponents to indicate reciprocals of numbers, for example and . But “sin” by itself is not a variable.   means “the angle whose sine is ”  means “the reciprocal of the sine of angle ”  (You may recall that denotes the inverse function for . We will study trigonometric functions in Chapter 4.)  Write the following fact in two different ways: is the angle whose cosine is . or  Find the angle of inclination of a hill if you gain 400 feet in elevation while traveling half a mile.  A sketch of the hill is shown at right. (Recall that 1 mile = 5280 feet.)    triangle  The angle of inclination of the hill is about .   The tallest living tree is a coast redwood named Hyperion, at 378.1 feet tall. If you stand 100 feet from the base of the tree, what is the angle of elevation of your line of sight to the top of the tree? Round your answer to the nearest degree.   The Special Angles  angle special  The trigonometric ratios for most angles are irrational numbers, but there are a few angles whose trig ratios are “nice” values. You already know one of these values: the sine of . Because the sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem, if we know any one of the trig ratios for an angle, we can find the others.  Recall that the side opposite a angle is half the length of the hypotenuse, so .   The figure at right shows a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse of length 2. The opposite side has length 1, and we can calculate the length of the adjacent side.  triangle   Now we know the cosine and tangent of .  These are exact values for the trig ratios, but we can also find decimal approximations. Use your calculator to verify the following approximate values.  It is important for you to understand the difference between exact and approximate values. These decimal approximations, like nearly all the other trig values your calculator gives you, are rounded off. Even if your calculator shows you ten or twelve digits, the values are not exactly correct -- although they are quite adequate for most practical calculations!  The angles , , and are “special” angle special because we can easily find exact values for their trig ratios, and use those exact values to find exact lengths for the sides of triangles with those angles.  The sides of an equilateral triangle are 8 centimeters long. Find the exact length of the triangle's altitude, .  The altitude divides the triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles as shown in the figure. The altitude is adjacent to the angle, and the hypotenuse of the right triangle is 8 centimeters. Thus,  45-45-90 triangle  The altitude is exactly centimeters long.   From this exact answer, we can find approximations to any degree of accuracy we like. You can check that , so the altitude is approximately 6.9 centimeters long.  Use the figure in the previous example to find exact values for the sine, cosine, and tangent of . , ,  There is one more special angle angle special : . We find the trig ratios for this angle using an isosceles right triangle. Because the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, they must both be .  The figure shows an isosceles right triangle with equal sides of length 1. You can use the Pythagorean theorem to show that the hypotenuse has length , so the trig ratios for are    45-45-90 triangle   The Trigonometric Ratios for the Special Angles  angle special  Here is a summary of the trig ratios for the special angles.    Trigonometric Ratios for the Special Angles   Angle  Sine  Cosine  Tangent                   You should be familiar with the exact values for these trig ratios. A good way to remember them is to know the two special triangles shown below. From these triangles, you can always write down the three trig ratios for the special angles.   45-45-90 triangle    30-60-90 triangle    You should also be able to recognize their decimal approximations.  We can use the special angles as benchmarks for estimating and mental calculation. For example, we know that sin , so if sin for some unknown angle , we know that , because as increases from the sine of increases also.  If , what can we say about ?  As an angle increases from to , its cosine decreases. Now, , so if , then must be less than .  If , what can we say about ?  Review the following skills you will need for this section.

Pythagorean Theorem : In a right triangle with hypotenuse .  If the sides of a triangle satisfy the relationship , then the triangle is a right triangle.  By using similar triangles, we can find the unknown sides of a right triangle if we know only one side and one of the acute angles.  Trigonometric Ratios  If is one of the angles in a right triangle,    triangle    The trigonometric ratio of an angle is the same for every right triangle containing the angle.  If we know one of the sides of a right triangle and any one of the other four parts, we can use trigonometry to find all the other unknown parts.  If we know one of the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle, we can find the angle using the inverse trig key on a calculator.  The exact values of trigonometric ratios of the special angles are useful benchmarks.

We know how to solve right triangles using the trigonometric ratios. But the triangle formed by the three towns is not a right triangle, because it includes an obtuse angle of at , as shown in the figure.  triangle  A triangle that is not a right triangle is called an oblique oblique triangle triangle oblique triangle. In this chapter we learn how to solve oblique triangles using the laws of sines and cosines. But first we must be able to find the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios for obtuse angles.   Angles in Standard Position  angle standard position  To extend our definition of the trigonometric ratios to obtuse angles, we use a Cartesian coordinate system. We put an angle in standard position as follows:  angle standard position   Place the vertex at the origin with the initial side initial side of an angle in standard position on the positive -axis;  the terminal side terminal side of an angle in standard position opens in the counter-clockwise direction.  We choose a point on the terminal side of the angle, and form a right triangle by drawing a vertical line from to the -axis.   The length of the side adjacent to is the -coordinate of point , and the length of the side opposite is the -coordinate of . The length of the hypotenuse is the distance from the origin to , which we call . With this notation, our definitions of the trigonometric ratios are as follows.

If we choose some other point, say , with coordinates , as shown at right, we will get the same values for the sine, cosine and tangent of . The new triangle formed is similar to the first one, so the ratios of the sides of the new triangle are equal to the corresponding ratios in the first triangle.  similar triangles  Find the values of cos , sin , and tan if the point is on the terminal side of .  For the point , we have and . We use the distance formula to find . The trig ratios are    angle  In the previous example, we get the same results by using the triangle definitions of the trig ratios. We create a right triangle by dropping a vertical line from to the -axis, as shown in the figure. The legs of the right triangle have lengths 12 and 5, and the hypotenuse has length 13.   Find the equation of the terminal side of the angle in the previous example. (Hint: The terminal side lies on a line that goes through the origin and the point .)

  "body": " The Law of Sines  law of sines  We have learned to use the trigonometric ratios to solve right triangles. But the trig ratios are only valid for the sides of right triangles. Can we find unknown sides or angles in an oblique triangle?  triangles  In this section and the next we find relationships among the sides and angles of oblique triangles. These relationships are called the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines. To derive these new rules, we use what we already know about right triangles.  Reducing a new problem to an earlier one is a frequently used technique in mathematics.  Consider the oblique triangle below. By drawing in the altitude of the triangle, we create two right triangles, and , as shown in the figure. Now we can write expressions in terms of for and for .   Looking at , we see that  Looking at , we see that   triangles  Now we solve each of these equations for :   We have derived a relationship between the angles and and their opposite sides, and . If we know any three of these quantities, we can find the fourth.  In a similar way, by drawing in the altitude from the vertex , we can show that Putting both results together, we have the Law of Sines . The Law of Sines is true for any triangle, whether it is acute, right, or obtuse.  Law of Sines  law of sines   If the angles of a triangle are , and , and the opposite sides are respectively and , then  triangle ABC  or equivalently,    Finding a Side  In the next example, we use the Law of Sines to find a distance.  Two observers onshore sight a ship at an unknown distance from the shore. The observers are 400 yards apart at points and , and they each measure the angle from the shoreline to the ship, as shown below. How far is the ship from the observer at ?  triangle  First note that is not a right triangle, so we cannot use the trig ratios directly to find the sides of this triangle.  The unknown distance is the side opposite . In order to use the Law of Sines, we must know another angle and the side opposite that angle. We do: we know that side , and we can compute the angle at the ship, . Now we apply the Law of Sines, using angles and . The ship is about 1315 yards from the observer at .   Delbert and Francine are 40 feet apart on one side of a river. They make angle measurements to a pine tree on the opposite shore as shown at right. What is the distance from Francine to the pine tree?  triangle About 114.8 feet   Solving Triangles with the Law of Sines  In order to apply the Law of Sines to find a side, we must know one angle of the triangle and its opposite side (either and , or and , or and ), and one other angle. Then we can find the side opposite that angle.  In the triangle shown at right, , and .  Find .  Solve the triangle.   triangle   We use the Law of Sines with and angle to find .   Evaluating this expression with a calculator, we find that .  The angle . Now we use the Law of Sines to find side . Note that it is safer to use the given side, , rather than the value we calculated for . so    In the triangle at right, , and . Solve the triangle. (Hint: Which side will you find first?)  triangle , ,   Finding an Angle  angle find  We can also use the Law of Sines to find an unknown angle of a triangle. We must know two sides of the triangle and the angle opposite one of them.   In the triangle shown at right, , and . Solve the triangle.  triangle  We must find the three remaining parts of the triangle, , and . First, we use the Law of Sines to find . So . Now we know two angles, and we can find angle . Finally, we use the Law of Sines to find side . Evaluating this expression with a calculator gives  Sketch a triangle with , and .  Use the Law of Sines to find another angle of the triangle.  Solve the triangle, and label your sketch with the results.      In the last example we used the value of to find angle . But there are two angles that satisfy , one acute (21.9 ) and one obtuse (158.1 ). How did we know which one to choose?  angles  In this case, the obtuse angle is too big to fit in the triangle, because angle . Sometimes both angles will produce (different) triangles, and sometimes only the acute angle will work. You should always check whether both angles provide solutions.   Because there can be more than one solution for a triangle in which we know two sides and an angle opposite one of them, this situation is called the ambiguous case ambiguous case for the Law of Sines. (See Homework Problems 33 42 for more about the ambiguous case.)  Find two triangles in which , and , and sketch both triangles.  Using the Law of Sines, we have There are two angles with sine :  the acute angle  or its supplement, .   Each of these angles produces a different solution triangle, because the angle and side will be different also.  In the first case, angle , and we have the triangle shown in figure (a).  In the second case, , which gives us the triangle shown in figure (b).    triangles   Suppose that , and .   Find two possible values for angle .  Solve the triangle for both values of , and sketch both solutions.   or    triangle     or   triangle       Applications  In the next example, we use two triangles to solve the problem.   Richard wants to measure the height of a castle controlled by hostile forces. When he is as close as he can get to the castle, the angle of elevation to the top of the wall is . He then retreats 20 yards and measures the angle of elevation again; this time it is . How tall is the castle?    castle      Notice that is one side of the right triangle . If we can find its hypotenuse, labeled in the figure, we can use the sine ratio to find . To find , we consider a second triangle, , as shown below.   castle     In this triangle, we know side and would like to find side . We can use the Law of Sines to find , but first we must calculate the other angles of the triangle.  Now, the angle opposite , is the complement of , so The angle opposite the 20-yard side, , is Now we can apply the Law of Sines to find . We have   So is about 139.9 yards. Finally, using the right triangle and the definition of sine, we can write   The castle is about 38.33 yards tall.   Solve the problem in the previous example again, but instead of finding , find the length , and then use to find .  , the castle is about 38.33 yards tall.   Measuring Astronomical Distances  parallax  If you look at a nearby object and alternately close your left and right eyes, the object seems to jump in position. This apparent change occurs because your eyes are viewing the object from two different positions spaced several centimeters apart. If the object at point is straight ahead of one eye, it appears to be at some angle away from the line of sight of the other eye. The angle is called the parallax parallax of the object.  Use the figure below to see that is also the angle between the directions to your two eyes when viewed from point . (What fact from geometry justifies this statement?)    parallax   Astronomers use parallax to determine the distance from earth to stars and other celestial objects. Two observers on Earth at a known distance apart both measure the direction to the star. The difference in angle between those two directions is the parallax.   Astronomers 1000 kilometers apart observe an asteroid with a parallax of . How far is the asteroid from Earth?  We let represent the distance to the asteroid. The asteroid and the two observers make an isosceles triangle with base 1000 km and equal sides of length , as shown below.    parallax   The base angles of the triangle are both . By the Law of Sines,   The asteroid is about 57 million kilometers from Earth (roughly one third of the distance to the Sun).  Two observers 800 kilometers apart observe an object with a parallax of . How far is the object from Earth?  About 91,673,247 km   Small Angles: Minutes and Seconds  To obtain the most accurate parallax measurements, the distance between the two observers should be as large as possible. But even measured from opposite sides of Earth's orbit, stars outside the solar system have parallaxes much smaller than .  In order to handle such small angles, we divide degrees into smaller units called minutes and seconds . One minute is of a degree, and 1 second is of a minute, or of a degree. We use the following notation for minutes and seconds.  Fractions of a Degree  minute (as a measure of angle)  second (as a measure of angle)   One minute:  One second:    When describing large distances, astronomers sometimes use the distance from Earth to the Sun, about 93 million miles, as the unit of measurement. This distance is called 1 Astronomical Unit astronomical unit (AU) , or 1 AU . For example, an object that is three times as far away as the Sun would be at a distance of 3 AU.  The star Wolf 359 has a parallax of when observed from opposites sides of Earth's orbit. How far away is the star?  In the figure below, the star Wolf 359 is located at point . Our Sun is located at point , halfway between the two observation points at and . Thus, the distance between the observation points is twice the distance from the Earth to the Sun, or 2 AU.    triangles   The altitude from to side forms a right triangle and bisects the angle at . Thus We use the definition of tangent to find   The star is approximately AU from Earth, or nearly half a million times the distance from Earth to the Sun.  Two observers are 1 AU (astronomical unit) apart. They find that the parallax to a distant star is . What is the distance to the star, in astronomical units?  (This distance is called a parsec parsec . In other words, a parsec is the distance at which the parallax from observations 1 AU apart is . In this Exercise, you are calculating the number of astronomical units in 1 parsec.) 1 parsec AU  Review the following skills you will need for this section.

We must know two sides of the triangle and the angle opposite one of them.  Remember that there are two angles with a given sine.

If we can find its hypotenuse, labeled in the figure, we can use the sine ratio to find . To find , we consider a second triangle, , as shown below.   castle     In this triangle, we know side and would like to find side . We can use the Law of Sines to find , but first we must calculate the other angles of the triangle.  Now, the angle opposite , is the complement of , so The angle opposite the 20-yard side, , is Now we can apply the Law of Sines to find . We have   So is about 139.9 yards. Finally, using the right triangle and the definition of sine, we can write   The castle is about 38.33 yards tall.  "

We can also use the Law of Sines when we know two sides and the angle opposite one of them. But the Law of Sines is not helpful for the problem that opened this chapter, finding the distance from Avery to Clio. In this case we know two sides of the triangle, and , and the included angle, .    triangle     To solve a triangle when we know two sides and the included angle, we will need a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem known as the Law of Cosines.  In a right triangle, with , the Pythagorean theorem tells us that If we allow angle to vary, but keep and the same length, the side will grow or shrink, depending on whether we increase or decrease the angle , as shown below.    triangle     The Pythagorean theorem Pythagorean theorem is actually a special case of a more general law that applies to all triangles, no matter what the size of angle . The equation relating the three sides of a triangle is You can see that when is a right angle, , so the equation reduces to the Pythagorean theorem.  We can write similar equations involving the angles or or . The three equations are all versions of the Law of Cosines.  Law of Cosines  law of cosines  If the angles of a triangle are , and , and the opposite sides are respectively and , then    For a proof of the Law of Cosines, see Homework Problems 57 and 58.   Finding a Side  Now we can solve the problem of the distance from Avery to Clio. Here is the figure from Section 3.1 showing the location of the three towns.  triangle    How far is it from Avery to Clio?   The angle . Thus, in we have and . The distance from Avery to Clio is represented by in the figure.   triangle     We know two sides and the included angle, and we choose the version of the Law of Cosines that uses our known angle, . Avery is about 73 miles from Clio.  When simplifying the Law of Cosines, be careful to follow the order of operations. In the previous example, the right side of the equation has three terms, and simplifies to Note that 3264 is the coefficient of , so it would be incorrect to subtract 3264 from 3460. If you are using a graphing calculator, you can enter the right side of the equation exactly as it is written.  In , , and . Find , and round your answer to two decimal places.  24.97   Finding an Angle  angle find  We can also use the Law of Cosines to find an angle when we know all three sides of a triangle. Pay close attention to the algebraic steps used to solve the equation in the next example.   In the triangle at right, , and . Find angle .   triangle     We choose the version of the Law of Cosines that uses angle . Angle is about .  In , , and . Find angle , and round your answer to two decimal places.   Once we have calculated one of the angles in a triangle, we can use either the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines to find a second angle. Here is how we would use the Law of Sines to find angle in the previous example.   Thus, . (We know that is an acute angle because it is opposite the shortest side of the triangle.) Finally, Alternatively, we can use the Law of Cosines to find angle .  Using the Law of Sines requires fewer calculations than the Law of Cosines, but the Law of Cosines uses only the original values, instead of the results of our previous calculations and approximations.  Whenever we round off a number, we introduce inaccuracy into the calculations, and these inaccuracies grow with each additional calculation. Thus, for the sake of accuracy, it is best to use given values in preference to calculated values whenever possible.   Using the Law of Cosines for the Ambiguous Case  ambiguous case  In Section 3.2 we encountered the ambiguous case:  If we know two sides and of a triangle and the acute angle opposite one of them, there may be one solution, two solutions, or no solution, depending on the size of in relation to and , as shown below.  The Ambiguous Case  ambiguous case   No solution:    triangle     is too short to make a triangle.  One solution:     triangle     is exactly the right length to make a right triangle.  Two solutions:    triangle     One solution:     triangle     If is an obtuse angle, things are simpler: there is one solution if , and no solution if .  Because there are always two angles with a given sine, if we use the Law of Sines for the ambiguous case, we must check whether both possible angles result in a triangle. But here is another approach: We can apply the Law of Cosines to find the third side first. With that method, we'll need the quadratic formula.  Quadratic Formula  quadratic formula  The solutions of the quadratic equation are given by   A quadratic equation can have one solution, two solutions, or no solution, depending on the value of the discriminant discriminant , . If we use the Law of Cosines to find a side in the ambiguous case, the quadratic formula will tell us how many triangles have the given properties.   If the quadratic equation has one positive solution, there is one triangle.  If the quadratic equation has two positive solutions, there are two triangles.  If the quadratic equation has no positive solutions, there is no triangle with the given properties.   In , and . Solve the triangle.  We begin by finding the third side of the triangle. Using the Law of Cosines, we have    Because there are two positive solutions for side , either or , there are two triangles with the given properties. We apply the Law of Cosines again to find angle in each triangle.  For the triangle with , we have   and .  For the triangle with , we have   and . Both triangles are shown below.    triangle     In the previous example, notice that we used the Law of Cosines instead of the Law of Sines to find a second angle in the triangle, because there is only one angle between and with a given cosine. We don't have to check the results, as we would if we used the Law of Sines.  Use the Law of Cosines to find all triangles with , and . No solution   Navigation  Even with the aid of GPS (Global Positioning System) instruments, aircraft pilots and ship captains need to understand navigation based on trigonometry.  The sailing club leaves the marina on a heading east of north and sails for 18 miles. They then change course, and after traveling for 12 miles on a heading east of north, they experience engine trouble and radio for help. The marina sends a speed boat to rescue them. How far should the speed boat go, and on what heading?   We'd like to find the distance and the angle shown in the figure. In , we can calculate the angle at point where the sailing club changed course: We know and . We use the Law of Cosines to find and .  triangle   Next, we apply the Law of Cosines again to find .   Thus, and . The speed boat should travel 29.56 miles on a heading east of north.   Howard wants to fly from Anchorage to Nome, Alaska, a distance of 540 miles on a heading west of north.

If we are solving a right triangle, we don't need the Laws of Sines and Cosines; all we need are the definitions of the trigonometric ratios.  But for oblique triangles, we can identify the following cases:   How to Solve an Oblique Triangle  oblique triangle  ambiguous case  SAA (one side and two angles)  SSA (two sides and non-included angle)  SAS (two sides and included angle)  SSS (three sides)  solve a triangle  triangle solving    If we know:  We can use:   1.

Law of Cosines, to find an angle    In the ambiguous case, SSA, the Law of Sines is easier to apply, but there will be two possible angles, and we must check each angle to see if it produces a solution. Using the Law of Cosines involves solving a quadratic equation, but each positive solution of the equation yields a solution of the triangle.   In the triangle at right, which law should you use to find ? Which law should you use to find ?  triangle  We know two sides of the triangle and the angle opposite one of them. We can use the Law of Sines to find .   This is the ambiguous case; there are two angles between and with sine , and we must check each angle to see if it produces a solution.

Coordinate Definitions of the Trigonometric Ratios         supplementary angles in standard position    Trigonometric Ratios for Supplementary Angles        supplementary angles in standard position    There are always two (supplementary) angles between and that have the same sine. Your calculator will only tell you one of them.  Area of a Triangle  If a triangle has sides of length and , and the angle between those two sides is , then the area of the triangle is given by   Triangle-angle-theta-sides-a-and-b    Law of Sines  If the angles of a triangle are , and , and the opposite sides are respectively and , then    triangle ABC  or equivalently,   We can use the Law of Sines to find an unknown side in an oblique triangle. We must know the angle opposite the unknown side, and another side-angle pair.  We can also use the Law of Sines to find an unknown angle of a triangle. We must know two sides of the triangle and the angle opposite one of them.  Remember that there are two angles with a given sine. When using the Law of Sines, we must check whether both angles result in possible triangles.  We use minutes and seconds to measure very small angles. Fractions of a Degree   One minute:  One second:    You can remember the trig values for the special angles if you memorize two triangles:   45-45-90 triangle  30-60-90 triangle   For the trigonometric ratios of most angles, your calculator gives approximations, not exact values. The Law of Sines is not helpful when we know two sides of the triangle and the included angle. In this case we need the Law of Cosines.  Law of Cosines  If the angles of a triangle are , and , and the opposite sides are respectively and , then    We can also use the Law of Cosines to find an angle when we know all three sides of a triangle.  We can use the Law of Cosines to solve the ambiguous case.  How to Solve an Oblique Triangle    If we know:  We can use:   1. One side and two angles (SAA)  1. Law of Sines, to find another side   2.

  "body": " Chapter 3 Activity   Understanding the Law of Sines  law of sines  Materials: You will need paper and pencil, a ruler, compass, and protractor, or a dynamic geometry program such as Geogebra.   The vertices of a triangle determine a unique circumscribing circle.  Draw a large acute triangle and label the vertices , , and .  Draw the perpendicular bisector of side . You can use a compass, or use your ruler and protractor as follows:  Find the midpoint, , of side .  Draw a line that passes through and is perpendicular to side .    Draw the perpendicular bisector of side . Label the point where the two perpendicular bisectors meet with the letter .   From geometry, we know that every point on the perpendicular bisector of a segment is equidistant between and . Use this fact to explain why the point is the same distance from each vertex of your triangle.  Using the point at as the center, draw the circle that passes through all three vertices of your triangle. The circle is called the circumscribing circle circle circumscribing of the triangle.   triangle with circumscribing circle       We can move a vertex around the circle without changing the measure of its angle.  Measure angle in your triangle. We say that this angle subtends subtend the arc joining and on the circle.  Choose any other point on the circle that is not on the arc . Call this point . Draw the line segments and to create a second triangle. Measure the angle at ; it should be the same as the angle .  In fact, all angles with vertex on the circle that subtend the same arc have the same measure. Verify this fact by creating two more angles that subtend the arc .    triangles inscribed in circle      What is the length of the diameter of the circumscribing circle?  At this point, if your drawing is too cluttered, you may need to make a fresh copy of the circumscribing circle. On this circle draw just the side from your original triangle.  Draw the diameter that passes through (remember that is the center of the circle), and label the other end of the diameter with the letter .  Draw triangle , and measure the angle at . It should be the same as angle in your original triangle. (Why?) Let's call this angle .  Now measure angle . It should be 90 degrees, This is another fact from geometry: Any angle that intercepts the diameter of a circle is a right angle. Put a right angle symbol at angle .  Label the length of the sides of your triangle as follows:  Side has length (for diameter)  Side has length  Side has length  (Notice that is the side opposite the angle ).

We can do the same for angles that represent rotations.   First, we place the angle in standard position, with its vertex at the origin. We picture the terminal side sweeping counter-clockwise around a circle to form the angle.  Next, we choose a point with coordinates on the terminal side, as shown at right.

  "body": " Graphs of Trigonometric Functions  trigonometric function graph  A Periodic Function of Angle  periodic function  Imagine that you are riding on a Ferris wheel. As the wheel turns, your height above the ground increases and then decreases again, repeating the same pattern each time the Ferris wheel makes a complete rotation. This pattern is an example of a periodic function periodic function . We use periodic functions to model phenomena that exhibit cyclical behavior, such as the height of tides, seasonal patterns of growth in plants and animals, radio waves, and planetary motion.  We'll create a mathematical model mathematical model for a ride on a Ferris wheel that has aradius of 100 feet and rotates counterclockwise. Our model will be a function that describes your height above the ground as you ride the wheel. In order to graph the Ferris wheel function, we must first specify the input and output variables, and then choose a coordinate system to display their values.  We'll place the origin at the center of the Ferris wheel. Then the line from the origin to your position on the wheel makes an angle with the horizontal, as shown at right. This angle, , will be the input variable input variable for the function. Your height, , is also a variable, and is related to the -coordinate of your position; in fact, we see that , because the center of the wheel is 100 feet above the ground.  ferris wheel  To simplify the model, we'll first graph as the output variable output variable , instead of . As the angle increases from to , your -coordinate increases from 0 to 100. You are then at the top of the wheel. Then, as increases from to , your -coordinate decreases from 100 back to 0.   ferris wheel  Finally, as increases from to , your -coordinate decreases from 0 to and then increases from back to 0. You have made one complete rotation on the Ferris wheel. If you go around again, increases from to , and the graph of your -coordinate will repeat the pattern of the first rotation. The figure above shows how your -coordinate is plotted as a function of the angle .  Look back at the diagram of the Ferris wheel and notice that , so  For example, when , the -coordinate is   and your height above the ground is  ferris wheel  In general, then, is given as a function of by This is our model for your height on a Ferris wheel ride.   The Sine Function  sine function  sine function sine  Our Ferris wheel model used values of , so let us explore its properties. Remember that the trigonometric ratio is actually a function of the angle . Thus, for each value of , there is only one value of , and we may write .   Graph the sine function .  We first make a table of values. You can use your calculator's table feature to verify the following values, rounded to two decimal places.                            If we plot the points in the table, we can graph the sine function in the first quadrant, from to . Recall that the values of in the second quadrant can be found using reference angles: . This fact gives us values of from to .                          The values of in the third and fourth quadrants are the negatives of their values in the second and first quadrants.                                                  The graph of from to is shown below.  sine graph  If we continue the graph for angles larger than or smaller than , we find that the same pattern repeats, as shown below. This should not be surprising, because we know that coterminal angles have the same trigonometric ratios.  sine graph  The sine is an example of a periodic function. periodic function The smallest interval on which the graph repeats is called the period period of the graph. From the graph in the previous example, we make the following observations:   The period of the sine function is .  The maximum and minimum function values are 1 and 1, respectively.  The graph oscillates around its midline midline , the horizontal line .  The distance between the midline and either the maximum or minimum value is called the amplitude amplitude of the function, so the amplitude of the sine function is 1.   You can use your calculator to graph the sine function, by entering  SIN    and pressing ZOOM  for the trig window. The graph shows two periods of the sine function, from to .  Your height on the Ferris wheel is a function of , Complete the table of values and graph the Ferris wheel function, .                                                         grid                                                         sine graph   The Cosine Function  cosine function  cosine function cosine  In the previous exercise you graphed the height of a person riding on a Ferris wheel. Your graph involved , because the sine function tells us the -coordinate of a point that travels around a circle. The cosine function tells us the -coordinate of a point that travels around a circle.   Small adjustments to the fit of a bicycle can affect both the cyclist's efficiency and the stress on his or her jounts. The KOPS rule (Knee Over Pedal Stem) aligns the cyclist's knee directly over the pedal at the point of maximum force, as shown at right. As the cyclist's foot rotates away from this KOPS line, stress on the knee increases.   bicycle   Suppose the pedal crank is 18 centimeters long. When the crank makes an angle with the horizontal, how far is the cyclist's foot displaced horizontally from the KOPS line?  Graph the horizontal displacement, , as a function of .    The cyclist's foot travels around a circle of radius 18 centimeters. If we place the origin at the center of the chain gear, the -coordinate of the foot is given by   (See the figure at right.) The KOPS line is the vertical line , so the horizontal distance between the cyclist's foot and the KOPS line is   KOPS line and circle  You can use your calculator to verify the table and graph for the function shown below.                                  cosine graph    You can see that the cosine graph is similar to the sine graph, but they are not identical.   Complete the table below with values rounded to two decimal places. Use the table and your knowledge of reference angles to graph the cosine function, from to .                             grid  Use your graph to find the period, amplitude, and midline of the cosine function. How does the graph of cosine differ from the graph of sine?

The cosine graph starts at its high point, while the sine graph starts at its midline.   Interlude: Review of Function Notation  function notation  Perhaps it is time to review our use of function notation. Recall that we use the notation function notation to indicate that is a function of , that is, input variable is the input variable and output variable is the output variable.  Make a table of input and output values and a graph for the function .  We choose several values for the input variable, , and evaluate the function to find the corresponding values of the output variable, . For example,  We plot the points in the table and connect them to obtain the graph shown at right.                      semicircle graph  Of course, we don't always use and for the input and output variables. In the previous example, we could write for the function, so that is the input and is the output. The table of values and the graph are the same; only the names of the variables have changed.  When we discuss trigonometric functions, there are several variables involved. Our definitions of the trig ratios involve four variables: , , , and , as illustrated below.   angles   graphs  If the value of is fixed for a given situation, such as the Ferris wheel or the bicycle wheel discussed above, then and are both functions of . This means that the values of and depend only on the value of the angle . If , we have The graphs of these functions are shown below. Note particularly that the horizontal axis displays values of the input variable, and the vertical axis displays the output variable.  cosine graph  sine graph  If we use different variables for the input and output, the functions and their graphs are the same, but the axes should be labeled with the appropriate variables.  Sketch a graph of each function, and label the axes.       sine graph  cosine graph    When we write , we are using \"cos\" as the name of a function whose input is .  A common mistake is to think of as a product, cos times  , but this makes no sense, because \"cos\" by itself has no meaning. Remember that represents a single number, namely the output of the cosine function.   The Tangent Function  tangent function  tangent function tangent  The tangent function is periodic, but its graph is not similar to the graphs of sine and cosine. Recall that the tangent of an angle in standard position is defined by Study the figure at right to see that as increases from to , increases while remains constant, so the value of increases.  Right triangles with a common base x and increasing y    Sketch a graph of for .  You can use your calculator to verify the following values for .                     As gets closer to , increases very rapidly. Recall that is undefined, so there is no point on the graph at . The graph of for is shown at right.  graph  For in the second quadrant, the tangent is negative. The reference angle for each angle in the second quadrant is its supplement, so    as shown at right. For example, you can verify that  supplementary angles   In particular, for values of close to , the values of are large negative numbers. We plot several points and sketch the graph in the second quadrant.                  In the figure at right, note that the graph has a break at , because is undefined.  tangent graph  Now let's consider the graph of in the third and fourth quadrants. The tangent is positive in the third quadrant, and negative in the fourth quadrant. In fact, from the figure below you can see that the angles and are vertical angles.    angles differing by 180 degrees     angles differing by 180 deg   Because and have the same reference angle, they have the same tangent. For example, Thus, the graph of in the third quadrant is the same as its graph in the first quadrant. Similarly, the graph of the tangent function in the fourth quadrant is the same as its graph in the second quadrant. The completed graph is shown below.  tangent graph    What is the period of the tangent function?  Does the graph of tangent have an amplitude?  For what values of is undefined?  Give the equations of any horizontal or vertical asymptotes for .    No  , and their coterminal angles     Period, Midline and Amplitude  All sine and cosine graphs have the characteristic \"wave\" shape we've seen in previous examples. But we can alter the size and frequency of the waves by changing the formula for the function. In the next example we consider three variations of the sine function.  Make a table of values and sketch a graph for each of the functions. How does each differ from the graph of ?        We make a table with multiples of .                          We plot the points, and connect them with a sine-shaped wave. Compare the graph, shown at right, to the graph of . The graph is like a sine graph, except that it oscillates between a maximum value of and a minimum value of . The amplitude of this function is 3.   graphs of sine and 3 sine     Again, we make a table of values with multiples of and plot the points.                          This graph has the same amplitude as , but the entire graph is shifted up by 3 units, as shown at right. The midline of this function is the line .   graph of sine and translated sine     This time we'll make a table with multiples of .                                You can continue the table for between and , and plot the points to find the graph shown at right. The graph has the same amplitude and midline as , but it completes three cycles from to instead of one cycle. The period of this graph is one-third of , or .   graph of sine and sine 3 theta    The graphs in the previous example illustrate a general rule about sine and cosine graphs.

  "body": " Using Trigonometric Functions  periodic function  Solving Trigonometric Equations  trigonometric equation  One of the main reasons we learned about reference angles is to help us solve trigonometric equations. Remember that there are always two angles between and with a given sine ratio between 0 and 1.  For example, the two solutions to the equation are and . That is, These two angles are supplementary, so they have the same reference angle, as shown below.   angles  angles  There are also two solutions between and to the equation . They are the angles in the third and fourth quadrants whose reference angle is , namely and , as shown above. But your calculator will only give you one of these angles!  You are riding on the Ferris wheel we modeled in Section 4.2, where your height above ground is given as a function of by When your height is at least 136 feet, you can see the snow on a distant mountain range. Between what angles of rotation can you see snow?   Look at the diagram of the Ferris wheel to see that when your height is 136 feet, the sine of the angle is , or 0.36. The angle with sine 0.36 is  ferris wheel where height is 136  And you will be able to see snow until you descend again below 136 feet. That will happen at the angle in the second quadrant with sine 0.36, namely, the second quadrant angle with reference angle 21.1°. And that angle is .   Refer to the Example in Section 4.2. about the Knee Over Pedal Stem Rule. The distance between the cyclist's foot and the KOPS line is At what angles is the cyclist's knee within 9 centimeters of the KOPS line? When the angle of the crank is between 0° and 60°, and again between 300° and 360°.  knee within 9cm of KOPS line   Solve the equation for angles between and . Round your answers to the nearest degree.  Use your calculator to evaluate The angle is in the fourth quadrant, but it is not between and . We need an angle that is coterminal with , so we add . Thus, one of the solutions is .   The sine is also negative in the third quadrant, so there should also be a solution in the third quadrant. The reference angle for is , and the third-quadrant angle with reference angle is , as shown at right. You can check that, rounded to four decimal places, both angles satisfy the equation, that is,   angles in 3rd and 4th quadrants   In the previous example we found two solutions of the equation . Actually, there are infinitely many solutions -- namely, all the angles coterminal with or . Because we can easily find coterminal solutions by adding or subtracting multiples of , when solving an equation we usually list only the solutions between and .  When you ask your calculator to find an angle with a given sine (or cosine or tangent), it will give you only one of the many possible answers. You must be careful to choose the appropriate answer for the situation, using reference and coterminal angles.  Solve the equation for angles between and . ,   The Unit Circle  unit circle  Now that we are thinking of angles as rotations, we'll introduce a tool called the unit circle that will be useful as we proceed.  Figure (a) below shows an angle of in standard position in a circle of radius 2. The hypotenuse of its reference triangle is the radius of the circle, so the legs of the triangle have lengths 1 and . The coordinates of the point where the terminal side meets the circle are thus . (You can check that these coordinates satisfy the equation of the circle, .)  angle on circle of radius 2   angle in unit circle  Now consider the circle of radius 1 in Figure (b). A circle of radius 1 is called a unit circle unit circle . In this figure, the hypotenuse of the reference triangle for has length 1. What are the coordinates of the point where the terminal side meets the circle? Each side of this triangle is the length of the sides of the similar triangle in Figure (a), so the coordinates of are . (Once again, you should check that these coordinates satisfy the equation of the circle, .)  Perhaps you recognize the coordinates of the point . Because in this circle, the definitions of the sine and cosine are We see that the coordinates of are given by . We have discovered an important property of unit circles.  Angles in a Unit Circle  unit circle angles in  unit circle coordinates of point  Let be a point on a unit circle determined by the terminal side of an angle in standard position. Then the coordinates of are given by    Find the coordinates of point on the unit circle shown at right.  angles  The coordinates of are given by .

Use a protractor to draw an angle in standard position. Repeat parts (a)-(d) for this new angle.  What do you notice about the coordinates of the point located on the unit circle by an angle and the values of the trig ratios of that angle?    Location by Coordinates  One of the most useful applications of the trigonometric ratios allows us to find distances or locations specified by angles. Starting with the definitions of sine and cosine, we can solve for and , the coordinates of points on the terminal side of the angle, and obtain the following results.  Coordinates  coordinates of point  coordinates of point polar coordinates  If point is located at a distance from the origin in the direction specified by angle in standard position, then the coordinates of are    These formulas make sense when we think of the unit circle. On a unit circle, the coordinates of a point designated by angle are , as shown at right. On a circle of radius , the angle forms a similar triangle whose dimensions are scaled up by a factor of . In particular, the legs of the new triangle are times larger than the original triangle.   circle   Point is located 6 centimeters from the origin in the direction of . Find the coordinates of , rounded to hundredths.   The location of point is shown at right. We see that , and we can use a calculator to evaluate and . The coordinates of are approximately .  angle    You find an old map that shows a buried treasure located 500 yards from the big oak tree in the direction , as shown below.

Find the tangent of . How far south should you walk from your present location before you begin digging?   angle  409.58 yds 286.79 yds    Bearings  bearing   Navigational directions for ships and planes are sometimes given as bearings bearing , which are angles measured clockwise from north. For example, a bearing of is equivalent to an angle of in standard position, or to its coterminal angle , as shown at right.  Bearing of 110 degrees  From this example, we see that to convert a bearing to an angle in standard position, we can subtract the bearing from , or  Francine leaves the airport at a bearing of and flies 60 miles. How far south of the airport is she at that time?  A bearing of is in the same direction as an angle of  in standard position, as shown at right, or as the coterminal angle .  Bearing of 245 degrees, 60 miles distance  We would like the -coordinate of Francine's position, so we calculate . Francine is about 25.4 miles south of the airport.  Delbert leaves the airport and flies 150 miles at a bearing of . How far east of the airport is he at that time? 111.5 mile   Angle of Inclination  angle of inclination   The tangent function also has applications in measurement. The figure at right shows a line in the -plane. The angle measured in the positive direction from the positive -axis to the line is called the angle of inclination of the line.  angle of inclination  Recall that the slope slope of a line is given by the ratio as we move from one point to another on the line. So, if we create a right triangle by dropping a perpendicular segment from the line to the -axis, the ratio of sides gives the slope of the line.  But the ratio is also the tangent of the angle .  Angle of Inclination  angle of inclination  angle of inclination  angle of inclination angle of inclination  The angle of inclination of a line is the angle measured in the positive direction from the positive -axis to the line.

What happens to the slope of a line as its angle of inclination increases from toward ?  What happens to the slope of a line as its angle of inclination decreases from toward ?      Consider the slopes of the lines shown at right, as increases.                     lines with different angles of inclination    The slopes increase towards infinity as increases. But the values of the slope are the values of , and if we plot those values against , we see the graph of the tangent function emerging.  graph      Now consider the slopes of the lines as decreases from toward .                   lines with different angles of inclination     The slopes decrease towards negative infinity as decreases.

Imagine a grandfather clock. As the minute hand sweeps around, the height of its tip changes with time. Which of the graphs shown below best represents the height of the tip of the minute hand as a function of time?   grandfather clock and 2 graphs   Figure (a) is not the graph of a function at all: It does not pass the vertical line test. That is, some values of , such as , correspond to more than one value of , which is not possible in the graph of a function.  Figure (b) shows the height of the minute hand varying between a maximum and minimum value. The height decreases at a constant rate (the graph is straight and the slope is constant) until the minimum is reached, and then increases at a constant rate.  But notice that during the 10 minutes from 12:10 to 12:20 the height of the minute hand decreases about half the diameter of the clock, while from 12:20 to 12:30 the height decreases only about a quarter of the diameter of the clock, as shown at right.   clock   Thus the height of the minute hand does not decrease at a constant rate.  Figure (c) is the best choice. The graph is curved because the slopes are not constant. The graph is steep when the height is changing rapidly, and the graph is nearly horizontal when the height is changing slowly. The height changes slowly near the hour and the half-hour, and more rapidly near the quarter-hours.

What is the heart rate, in beats per minute, of the person whose blood pressure is shown in the graph?   systolic 120 mm Hg, diastolic 80 mm Hg, pulse pressure 40 mm Hg.   72 beats per minute   Here is a tide chart for Los Angeles for the week of December 17–23, 2000. The horizontal axis shows time in hours, with corresponding to noon on December 17. The vertical axis shows the height of the tide in feet above mean sea level.  graph   High tides occurred at 3:07 am and 2:08 pm on December 17, and low tides at 8:41 am and 9:02 pm. Estimate the heights of the high and low tides on that day.  Is tide height a periodic function of time? Use the information from part (a) to justify your answer.  Make a table showing approximate times and heights for the high tides throughout the week. Make a similar table for the low tides.  Describe the trend in the heights of the high tides over the week. Describe the trend in the heights of the low tides.  What is the largest height difference between consecutive high and low tides during the week shown? When does it occur?   The apparent magnitude of a star is a measure of its brightness as seen from earth. Smaller values of apparent magnitude correspond to brighter stars. The graph below, called a light curve, shows the apparent magnitude of the star Algol as a function of time. Algol is actually a system of two stars, a bright principal star and its dimmer companion, in orbit around each other. As each star passes in front of the other it eclipses some of the light that reaches earth.  graph   The light curve is periodic. What is its period?  What is the range of apparent magnitudes of the Algol system?  Explain the large and small dips in the light curve. What is happening to cause the dips?   69 hours.  2.2 to 3.5  The larger dip corresponds to when the brighter star is eclipsed, the smaller dip corresponds to when the dimmer star is eclipsed.   Some stars, called Cepheid variable stars, appear to pulse, getting brighter and dimmer periodically. The graph shows the light curve for the star Delta Cephei.  graph   What is the period of the graph?  What is the range of apparent magnitudes for Delta Cephei?    "

Positive angles indicate rotation in the counter-clockwise direction; negative angles describe clockwise rotation.  We define the trigonometric ratios of any angle by placing the angle in standard position and choosing a point on the terminal side, with . The Trigonometric Ratios  If is an angle in standard position, and is a point on its terminal side, with , then   To construct a reference triangle for an angle :   Choose a point on the terminal side.  Draw a line from point perpendicular to the -axis.   The reference angle for is the positive acute angle formed between the terminal side of and the -axis.    Reference angles for all quadrants     The trigonometric ratios of any angle are equal to the ratios of its reference angle, except for sign. The sign of the ratio is determined by the quadrant.  To find an angle with a given reference angle :    Quadrant I:   Quadrant II:   Quadrant III:   Quadrant IV:     angles     There are always two angles between and (except for the quadrantal angles) with a given trigonometric ratio.  Coterminal angles have equal trigonometric ratios.  To solve an equation of the form , or , or , we can use the appropriate inverse trig key on a calculator to find one solution (or a coterminal angle.) We use reference angles to find a second solution between and .  Angles in a Unit Circle  Let be a point on a unit circle determined by the terminal side of an angle in standard position. Then the coordinates of are given by  Coordinates  If point is located at a distance from the origin in the direction specified by angle in standard position, then the coordinates of are   Navigational directions for ships and planes are sometimes given as bearings , which are angles measured clockwise from north.  Periodic functions are used to model phenomena that exhibit cyclical behavior.  The trigonometric ratios and are functions of the angle .  The period of the sine function is . Its midline is the horizontal line , and the amplitude of the sine function is 1.  The graph of the cosine function has the same period, midline, and amplitude as the graph of the sine function. However, the locations of the intercepts and of the maximum and minimum values are different.  We use the notation to indicate that is a function of , that is, is the input variable and is the output variable.  The tangent function has period . It is undefined at odd multiples of , and is increasing on each interval of its domain.  Angle of Inclination  The angle of inclination of a line is the angle measured in the positive direction from the positive -axis to the line. If the slope of the line is , then where .  Amplitude, Period, and Midline   The graph of has amplitude .  The graph of has period .  The graph of has midline .   The graph of has amplitude , period , and midline . The same is true for the graph of .  Functions that have graphs shaped like sines or cosines are called sinusoidal .  Periodic Function  The function is periodic if there is a smallest value of such that for all . The constant is called the period of the function.     Chapter 4 Review Problems  The London Eye, the world's largest Ferris wheel, completes one revolution every 30 minutes. By how many degrees will it rotate in 1 minute?  The London Eye in Problem 1 has 32 cabins evenly spaced along the wheel. If the cabins are numbered consecutively from 1 to 32, what is the angular separation between cabins number 1 and number 15?   For Problems 3 4,find two angles, one positive and one negative, that are coterminal with the given angle.

  "title": "Algebra with Trigonometric Ratios",
  "body": " Algebra with Trigonometric Ratios  In this chapter we apply some techniques from algebra to analyze more complicated trigonometric expressions. Before we begin, let's review some algebraic terminology.   An algebraic expression expression algebraic expression algebraic expression expression is any meaningful collection of numbers, variables, and operation symbols. For example, the height of a golf ball is given in feet by the expression , where is the number of seconds after the ball is hit.  We evaluate evaluate an expression by substituting a specific value for the variable or variables involved. Thus, after 1 second, the height of the golf ball is and after 2 seconds, the height is and so on.   Evaluating Trigonometric Expressions  trigonometric expression  expression trigonometric  expression trigonometric trigonometric expression  Trigonometric ratios represent numbers, and they may appear as part of an algebraic expression. Expressions containing trig ratios can be simplified or evaluated like other algebraic expressions.  Keep in mind that , for example, is not a product: it does not mean \"sin times X\" (whatever that might be). Instead, \"sin\" is the name of a function, and means to evaluate the sine function at X. Thus, is a single number, the output of the sine function.  Evaluate each expression for and .       Substituting the values for and , we get Next, we evaluate each trig ratio and follow the order of operations.  This expression includes the product of two trig ratios, .   Evaluate each expression for , .         In the previous Exercise, is not equal to . That is, (You can check this for yourself.) We must follow the order of operations and evaluate the expression inside parentheses before applying the sine function.   Simplifying Trigonometric Expressions  trigonometric expression simplifying  When we simplify simplify an algebraic expression, we obtain a new expression that has the same values as the old one, but is easier to work with. For example, we can apply the distributive law and combine like terms to simplify The new expression is equivalent equivalent to the old one, that is, the expressions have the same value when we evaluate them at any value of . For instance, you can check that, at , To simplify an expression containing trig ratios, we treat each ratio as a single variable. Compare the two calculations below: Both calculations are examples of combining like terms. In the second calculation, we treat and as variables, just as we treat and as variables in the first calculation.  Simplify.       Combine like terms. Note that and are not like terms.

An equation equation is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal. It may be true or false, depending on the values of any variables involved. Here are some examples of equations. The first equation is true, the second is false, and the third equation is true only if or . When you solve solve an equation an equation, you are finding the values of the variable that make the equation true.   Evaluate for .  Solve .    Substitute into the expression to find  We must find a value for that makes equal to 20. In part (a) we saw that this expression equals 20 when , so the solution of the equation is .   Use trial and error to find a solution of the equation  Try small integer values for .  You probably remember a number of algebraic techniques for solving equations of different types. Another useful equation-solving method uses graphs. solve an equation using a graph  Use a graph to solve the equation .  We graph the expressions on either side of the equation, that is, we graph and on the same grid, as shown below.   We are looking for any values of where the two -values are equal, and these occur at the intersection points of the two graphs. At those points, the -values are and , and these are the solutions of the equation. You can check that all three values make the equation true.  cubic graph  Use a graph to show that the equation has no real-valued solutions. The graph does not cross the line .   parabola   Trigonometric Equations  trigonometric equation  equation trigonometric  equation trigonometric trigonometric equation  The first Ferris wheel was built for the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. It had a diameter of 250 feet and could carry 2160 people in 36 carriages. From the top of the wheel, passengers could see into four states. After loading all the passengers, the wheel made one revolution in nine minutes.  If you are in the bottom carriage of the Ferris wheel at the start of its revolution, your height after seconds is given by For how long are you more than 240 feet above the ground?  The figure below shows a graph of the height function and a horizontal line at .  sinusoidal graph  From the graph, we see that at approximately 215 seconds and 325 seconds into the ride. Your height is more than 240 feet between those two times, or for about 110 seconds.   Solving Trigonometric Equations  trigonometric equation solving  solve trigonometric equations  solve trigonometric equations trigonometric equation  In the example above, we used a graph to solve the equation , or To find a more precise solution, we can use algebraic methods. As an example, we'll solve the slightly simpler equation We'll look for all solutions for between and . We begin by isolating the trigonometric ratio on one side of the equation. We have solved equations like this one before: we use the inverse cosine to solve for . Remember that there are two angles between and that have a cosine of , one in the second quadrant and one in the third quadrant. The calculator will give us only the second quadrant solution. To find the second solution, we need the third-quadrant angle whose cosine is .   Now, the reference angle for is and the angle in the third quadrant with the same reference angle is (See the figure at right.) Thus, the other solution is .  angles  To solve simple equations involving a single trigonometric ratio (either or ), we can follow the steps below.  To Solve a Trigonometric Equation for  trigonometric equation solving   Isolate the trigonometric ratio.  Find one solution.  Give an exact solution if the trig ratio is one of the special values.  Otherwise use the inverse trig keys on a calculator.  Use reference angles to find a second solution (if there is one).   In step 3, note that if the first solution is a quadrantal angle, there may not be a second solution. Consider, for example, the equation .  Solve the equation for .  We begin by isolating the trig ratio.   We recognize that for one of the special angles, namely , and also for the obtuse angle , as shown at right.  angles  Note that is the second-quadrant angle with reference angle . Because the sine is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, there are no other solutions between and . The solutions we want are and .  To solve the equation in the previous example, it is not enough to find the solution ; we must find all the solutions between and . To find the solutions in other quadrants, we use reference angles.  In the previous example, we found two solutions of the equation . The equation actually has infinitely many solutions, as you can see in the figure below, which shows a graph of and the horizontal line . The line intersects the sine graph infinitely many times, twice in each cycle.   sinusoidal graph  Each intersection represents a solution of the equation. Thus, all of the angles coterminal with and are also solutions. We can easily find these solutions by adding integer multiples of to or . This is why, when solving a trigonometric equation, we usually list only the solutions in one cycle, typically those between and .  Solve the equation for .  We can use a calculator to help us solve equations that do not involve special angles.  Solve the equation for . Round your solutions to three decimal places.  First, we isolate the trig ratio.   There are two angles with tangent -3, one in the second quadrant and one in the fourth quadrant. The calculator finds the solution This angle is in the fourth quadrant, but it is not between and .   angles     The angle we want is coterminal with , so we add to get the first solution:  The other solution is in the second quadrant, as shown in the figure. This angle is less than the fourth quadrant solution:  In the previous example, notice that the solutions are apart. The solutions of an equation always differ by , so the use of reference angles is not necessary for these equations: once we have found one solution, we can add or subtract to find the other solution between and . (See Homework Problems 69 and 70.)  Solve the equation , for . Round your solutions to three decimal places. or  Some trigonometric equations have no solution. As we can observe from their graphs or from their definitions, the sine and cosine functions only have values ranging from to .  Solve for .  We begin by isolating .

Use a graph to verify your solutions to from .   sinusoidal graph    Equations with Squares of Trig Ratios  trigonometric equation with squares of trig ratios  Simple quadratic equations can be solved by extracting roots. For example, to solve the equation we first isolate : and then take square roots of both sides to find Recall that a quadratic equation may have two real solutions, one (repeated) real solution, or no real solutions. We can use extraction of roots to solve trigonometric equations as well.  Solve for .  We begin by isolating the power of tangent, . Next, we solve for by extracting roots. There are two angles between and with tangent and two angles with tangent , making four solutions to this equation. We know that , so one of the solutions is .   The tangent function is also positive in the third quadrant, and the angle in the third quadrant with reference angle is . The angles in the second and fourth quadrants with reference angle have tangent . These angles are  angles   The four solutions are shown at right.  Solve the equation for . , , , or  Other quadratic equations can be solved by factoring.

This distortion is caused by refraction of light. Light rays bend when they pass from one medium to another, for instance from water to glass or from glass to air. spoon in glass of water  A light ray enters the boundary between the two media at a certain angle, called the angle of incidence angle of incidence , but leaves the boundary at a different angle, the angle of refraction angle of refraction . Both angles are acute angles measured from the normal normal line line perpendicular to the boundary, as shown below.  The change of angle is caused by the fact that light travels at different speeds in different media. The relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction is given by Snell's Law Snell's Law :  water-glass interface  where is the angle in the medium where light travels at speed , and is the angle where light travels at speed . The ratio of the speeds is called the index of refraction .  The index of refraction from water to glass is 1.1. If light passes from water to glass with a angle of incidence, what is the angle of refraction?  If is the angle of refraction, then from Snell's Law we have Because , (For Snell's Law we use only acute angles.) The angle of refraction is approximately .

  "body": " Trigonometric Identities  What is an Identity?  identity  Recall that an equation may be true or false, depending on the values of any variables involved. For example, the equation is true only if or . An equation that is true only for certain values of the variable, and false for others, is called a conditional equation equation conditional . When you solve a conditional equation, you are finding the values of the variable that make the equation true.  Some equations are true for all legitimate values of the variables. Such equations are called identities identity . Here are some examples of identities. In an identity, the expressions on either side of the equal sign are equivalent expressions , because they have the same value for all values of the variable.  Identity  identity  An identity is an equation that is true for all legitimate values of the variables.  Which of the following equations are identities?        Many of the algebraic operations you have already learned, such as combining like terms or applying the distributive law, produce equivalent expressions.   Equation (a) is an identity obtained by combining like terms on the left side.  Equation (b) is an identity obtained by applying the distributive law on the left side.  Equation (c) is not an identity, because the equation is true only for .   Which of the following equations are identities?       (a) and (c)  Of course, you wouldn't be asked to solve an identity, because all values of the variable are solutions. Instead, we use identities to replace one form of an expression by a more useful form. You do this when you solve a quadratic equation by factoring. For example, Because is equivalent to , we have not changed the equation or its solutions. But now we can apply the Zero Factor principle and solve the equation.  Using identities is especially useful when we are working with trigonometric ratios.   Using Trigonometric Ratios in Identities  trigonometric identity  identity with trigonometric ratios  identity with trigonometric ratios trigonometric identity  Because the identity is true for any value of , it is true when is replaced, for instance, by . This gives us a new identity Expressions involving can be manipulated by the same rules (such as the distributive law or the laws of exponents) that we use with simple variables.  Which of the following equations are identities?        These equations are obtained from the equations in the previous example by replacing the variable with , the variable with , and the variable with . Equations (a) and (b) are identities, and equation (c) is not, for the same reasons as before.  Which of the following equations are identities?       (a) and (c)  To show that an equation is not an identity, we need only find one value of the variable for which the equation is false. However, to show that a given equation is an identity, it is not enough to show that the equation is true for one or even a dozen values of the variable. The equation must be true for all legitimate values of the variable. Because we cannot check all values of the variable numerically, we must use algebraic methods to prove that an equation is an identity.  Checking Identities Graphically  identity check graphically  Is the equation an identity? The answer is no! Even though the equation is true for all positive values of , it is false for negative values of . For example, if , then so . Because the radical symbol stands for the nonnegative square root, the left side of the equation, , is never negative. Therefore, cannot equal when is a negative number. The equation is false for .  One way to see that and are not equivalent is to compare the graphs of and , shown below. You can see that and do not have the same value for .  two graphs  Thus, to check to whether an equation is an identity, we can compare graphs of (left side of the equation) and (right side of the equation). If the two graphs are identical, the equation is an identity. If the two graphs are not the same, the equation is not an identity.  Which of the following equations are identities?       Compare the graphs of and . Enter the two equations in the ZTrig window and press ZOOM  to see the graphs shown below.  graph  To help distinguish which graph is which, we can use the calculator's trace feature, illustrated in the figure at right. Because there are two distinct graphs, the expressions and are not equivalent, and consequently is not an identity.  This time we graph and . Although the graphs appear to be identical, when we use the trace feature we see that their -values differ at (and at many other values of .) See the figures below.  graph  The graphs are so close together that calculator's resolution does not distinguish them, but tracing the graphs reveals that they are not identical. Because the two graphs differ, the equation is not an identity.    The example above illustrates the fact that graphs can be deceiving: even if two graphs look identical, it is always a good idea to check some numerical values as well.  Remember that we can use graphs to prove that an equation is not an identity, if the two graphs are clearly different, but to prove that an equation is an identity, we will need algebraic methods.  Use graphs to decide which of the following equations are identities.

We begin by considering the relationship between and . Complete the following table with exact values.                                              You should find that all the entries in the last column are 1.   For all of the angles in the table, We can verify that this equation holds for all angles by graphing the expressions on either side of the equal sign. The graphs of these two functions in the ZTrig window are shown at right.  graph  We see that the graph of appears identical to the horizontal line . In fact, the graphs are identical, and the equation is an identity. It is important enough to earn a special name.  Pythagorean Identity  Pythagorean identity  For any angle ,  As you might guess from its name, the Pythagorean identity is true because it is related to the Pythagorean theorem. We have not actually proved the identity, and a skeptical student may wonder if is only very close to 1, or if it equals 1 for only some values of . Homework Problem 77 offers a proof of the Pythagorean identity.  Evaluate without using a calculator.  Because the identity is true for any value of , it is true in particular for . So .  Evaluate without using a calculator.  When we solve more complicated trigonometric equations in later chapters, we will need to simplify trigonometric expressions so that they involve only one of the trig functions. The Pythagorean identity is useful when we wish to write an equivalent expression for either or for . Note that we can write the identity in two alternate forms:  Alternate Forms of the Pythagorean Identity  Pythagorean identity alternate forms    Rewrite as an expression involving only.  Using one of the alternate forms of the Pythagorean identity, we replace by to get  In the previous example, we have shown that is an identity.   If we graph  graph  for we see that they have the same graph, as shown in the figure.   Rewrite as an expression in .  Verify your identity by graphing.    Tangent Identity  tangent identity  There is also a relationship between the tangent ratio and the sine and cosine. Complete the following table with exact values. You should find that the entries in the last two columns are identical.                                  For the angles in the table, Because , the quotient is undefined for , and is undefined, too. The same is true for . For all other angles between and , . A proof of the tangent identity is outlined in Homework Problem 78.  Tangent Identity  tangent identity  For any angle not coterminal with or ,  Now we can see how to use identities to simplify trigonometric expressions. One strategy for simplifying a trigonometric expression is to reduce the number of different trig ratios involved. We can use the tangent identity to replace the tangent ratio by sines and cosines.  Simplify the expression .  We apply the tangent identity to replace by and obtain  Simplify the expression .   Trig Ratios are Related  All three of the trigonometric functions of an angle are related. If we know the value of one of the three, we can calculate the other two (up to sign) by using the Pythagorean and tangent identities. We do not need to find the angle itself in order to do this. We need only know in which quadrant the angle lies to determine the correct sign for the trig ratios.  If and find and .  We substitute into the Pythagorean identity to get Because is between and , must be negative, so . To find , we use the tangent identity.    We can also solve the previous example by sketching an appropriate triangle. We begin by drawing an obtuse angle and its reference triangle. Because , we can choose a point on the terminal side to have -coordinate 7 and , as shown below. In order to calculate and , we must find the -coordinate of the point. By the Pythagorean theorem,    angle  Note that is negative because the point is in the second quadrant. Then   If and find and .  Find and by using an appropriate sketch.  ,   Solving Equations  trigonometric equation solving  Now we'll see how identities are useful for solving trigonometric equations. So far we have only solved equations that involve a single trigonometric ratio. If the equation involves more than one trig function, we use identities to rewrite the equation in terms of a single trig function.  Solve for .  The equation involves both the cosine and sine functions, and we will rewrite the left side in terms of the sine only. To eliminate the cosines, we use the Pythagorean identity . Set each factor equal to zero to see that either or . Now, when or , and when . The solutions are , or .  Solve for . , ,  Like the Pythagorean identity, the tangent identity can be helpful in solving trigonometric equations.  Solve for .  We first try to write the equation in terms of a single trig function.   Because , we see that has a reference angle of . And because the tangent is negative in the second and fourth quadrants, we have or , as shown in the figure.  angle  Solve for . ,   Proving Identities  identity proving  When we show that one trigonometric expression is equivalent to another expression, we have proved a trigonometric identity. In a previous example we proved that the equation is an identity; it is true for all values of . A common strategy for proving an identity is to transform one side of the equation using equivalent expressions until it is identical to the other side. To help us choose the transformations at each step of the proof, we try to match the algebraic form of the final expression.  Prove the identity  By manipulating the left side of the equation, we will show that the expression is equivalent to . First, we use the tangent identity to write the expression in terms of sines and cosines: Next, we notice that the right side of the proposed identity has only one term, so we combine the terms on the left side. So that the fractions have the same denominator, we write 1 as . Finally, we apply the Pythagorean identity to the numerator. Thus, , and the identity is proved.  When you write out the proof of an identity, you should transform the expression on one side of the identity into the expression on the other side, showing one step of the calculation on each line of your proof. You can provide a justification for each step to the right of the calculation. The proof of the identity in the previous example would look like this:  Prove the identity  Review the following skills you will need for this section.   Write each expression as a single fraction in simplest form.              Algebra Refresher Answers               Section 5.3 Summary  Vocabulary   Conditional equation  Identity  Equivalent expressions    Concepts   An equation that is true only for certain values of the variable, and false for others, is called a conditional equation . An equation that is true for all legitimate values of the variables is called an identity .  The expressions on either side of the equal sign in an identity are called equivalent expressions , because they have the same value for all values of the variable.  We often use identities to replace one form of an expression by a more useful form.  To check to whether an equation is an identity we can compare graphs of (left side of the equation) and (right side of the equation). If the two graphs agree, the equation is an identity. If the two graphs are not the same, the equation is not an identity.  Pythagorean Identity  For any angle , Alternate forms:  Tangent Identity  For any angle not coterminal with or ,  To solve an equation involving more than one trig function, we use identities to rewrite the equation in terms of a single trig function.  To prove an identity, we write one side of the equation in equivalent forms until it is identical to the other side of the equation.

  "body": " Chapter 5 Summary and Review  Key Concepts   Expressions containing trig ratios can be simplified or evaluated like other algebraic expressions. To simplify an expression containing trig ratios, we treat each ratio as a single variable.  The parentheses in an expression such as indicate function notation, not multiplication.  We write to denote , and to denote . (Similarly for the other trig ratios.)  An equation is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal. It may be true or false.  We can solve equations by trial and error, by using graphs, or by algebraic techniques.  To solve a trigonometric equation, we first isolate the trigonometric ratio on one side of the equation. We then use reference angles to find all the solutions between and .  An equation that is true only for certain values of the variable, and false for others, is called a conditional equation . An equation that is true for all legitimate values of the variables is called an identity .  The expressions on either side of the equal sign in an identity are called equivalent expressions , because they have the same value for all values of the variable.  We often use identities to replace one form of an expression by a more useful form.  To check to whether an equation is an identity we can compare graphs of (left side of the equation) and (right side of the equation). If the two graphs agree, the equation is an identity. If the two graphs are not the same, the equation is not an identity.  Pythagorean Identity  For any angle , Alternate forms:  Tangent Identity  For any angle not coterminal with or ,  To solve an equation involving more than one trig function, we use identities to rewrite the equation in terms of a single trig function.  To prove an identity, we write one side of the equation in equivalent forms until it is identical to the other side of the equation.     Chapter 5 Review Problems  For Problems 1 4, evaluate the expressions for and . Give exact values for your answers.       For Problems 5 8, evaluate the expressions using a calculator.

We can use angles in standard position to describe your location as you travel around the wheel. The figure at right shows the locations indicated by and . But degrees are not the only way to specify location on a circle.   triangle  We could use percent of one complete rotation and label the same locations by . Or we could use the time elapsed, so that for this example we would have minutes.  Another useful method to describe your location uses the distance traveled, or arclength , along the circle. How far have you traveled around the Ferris wheel at each of the locations shown?  Before we consider that question, let's agree on some vocabulary. An arc is a portion of a circle, and its length, quite naturally, is called arclength . An angle with vertex at the center of the circle is called a central angle , and a central angle whose sides meet the endpoints of an arc is said to subtend the arc. Or we may say that the angle spans the arc. If the arc represents a distance traveled, we sometimes refer to such an angle as the angle of displacement .   Arclength  arclength  Recall that the circumference of a circle is proportional to its radius, If we walk around the entire circumference of a circle, the distance we travel is times the length of the radius, or about 6.28 times the radius. If we walk only part of the way around the circle, then the distance we travel depends also on the angle of displacement.  For example, an angle of is of a complete revolution, so the the length of the arc from point to point , called in the figure at right, is of the circumference. Thus  arc on circle   Similarly, the angle of displacement from point to point is of a complete revolution, so the arclength along the circle from to , shown at right, is  arc on circle   In general, for a given circle the length of the arc spanned by an angle is proportional to the size of the angle.  Arclength on a Circle  arclength   The Ferris wheel in the introduction has circumference so in half a revolution you travel 314 feet around the edge, and in one-quarter revolution you travel 157 feet.   To indicate the same four locations on the wheel by distance traveled, we would use , as shown at right.  circle  What length of arc is spanned by an angle of on a circle of radius 12 centimeters?  Because , an angle of is of a complete revolution, as shown at right.   Using the formula above with , we find that or about 25.1 cm.  arc on circle  How far have you traveled around the edge of a Ferris wheel of radius 100 feet when you have turned through an angle of ? ft    Measuring Angles in Radians  radian  angle in radians  angle in radians radian  If you think about measuring arclength, you will see that the degree measure of the spanning angle is not as important as the fraction of one revolution it covers. This observation suggests a new unit of measurement for angles, one that is better suited to calculations involving arclength. We'll make one change in our formula for arclength, from to We'll call the quantity in parentheses, (fraction of one revolution ), the radian measure of the angle that spans the arc.  Radians  radian  The radian measure of an angle is given by  For example, one complete revolution, or , is equal to radians, and one-quarter revolution, or , is equal to or radians. The figure below shows the radian measure of the quadrantal angles.   angle on unit circle from positive x-axis to positive y-axis  angle on unit circle from positive x-axis to negative x-axis  angle on unit circle from positive x-axis to negative y-axis  angle on unit circle from positive x-axis counterclockwise back to positive x-axis  What is the radian measure of an angle of ?  An angle of is of a complete revolution, as we saw in the previous example. Thus, an angle of has a radian measure of , or .   What fraction of a revolution is radians? How many degrees is that? Half a revolution,  Radian measure does not have to be expressed in multiples of . Remember that , so one complete revolution is about 6.28 radians, and one-quarter revolution is , or about 1.57 radians. The figure below shows decimal approximations for the quadrantal angles.     Degrees  Radians: Exact Values  Radians: Decimal Approximations                       Quadrantal angles on unit circle radian approximation    Because they are \"benchmarks\" for comparing angles, you should be very familiar with both the exact values of these angles in radians and their approximations!  In which quadrant would you find an angle of 2 radians? An angle of 5 radians?  Look at the figure above. The second quadrant includes angles between and , or 1.57 and 3.14 radians, so 2 radians lies in the second quadrant. An angle of 5 radians is between 4.71 and 6.28, or between and radians, so it lies in the fourth quadrant.  Draw circles centered at the origin and sketch (in standard position) angles of approximately 3 radians, 4 radians, and 6 radians.  circle  circle  circle   It turns out that measuring angles in radians is useful for many applications besides calculating arclengths, so we need to start thinking in radians. To help that process, we'll first learn to convert between degrees and radians.   Converting Between Degrees and Radians  It is not difficult to convert the measure of an angle in degrees to its measure in radians, or vice versa. One complete revolution is equal to radians or to , so If we divide both sides of this equation by , we get a fraction that is equal to 1: And of course it is also true that  Because multiplying by 1 does not change the value of a number, we can use these fractions to convert between degrees and radians.  Converting between degrees and radians   To convert from radians to degrees we multiply the radian measure by .  To convert from degrees to radians we multiply the degree measure by .     Convert 3 radians to degrees.  Convert 3 degrees to radians.        Convert to radians. Give both an exact answer and an approximation to three decimal places.  Convert radians to degrees.  radians  Thus, the fraction (or its reciprocal ) gives us a conversion factor between degrees and radians:  Unit Conversion for Angles  angle converting measurement units    You can review the use of conversion factors in the Algebra Refresher at the end of this Section.   From our conversion factor we also learn that So while is a relatively small angle, 1 radian is much larger — nearly , in fact.  circle  But this is reasonable, because there are only a little more than 6 radians in an entire revolution. An angle of 1 radian is shown above.  We'll soon see that, for many applications, it is easier to work entirely in radians. For reference, the figure below shows a radian protractor.  triangle   Arclength Formula  arclength formula  Now let us return to our calculation of arclength, and we'll see the first instance in which measuring angles in radians is useful: To calculate an arclength we need only multiply the radius of the circle by the radian measure of the spanning angle, . Look again at our formula for arclength:  The quantity in parentheses, fraction of one revolution , is just the measure of the spanning angle in radians. Thus, if is measured in radians, we have the following simple formula for arclength, .  Arclength Formula  arclength formula  On a circle of radius , the length of an arc spanned by an angle in radians is   Thus, there is a special relationship between arclength and radians. An angle of 1 radian spans an arc on a circle equal to the radius of the circle, as shown at right. And the length of any arc is just the measure of its spanning angle in radians times the radius of the circle.  arcs on circles   So for instance, we can use the formula to find the arclength spanned by an angle of 2.5 radians on a circle of radius six inches:  arcs on circles  We can also use the formula in the form to find an angle that spans a given arc. For example, an arclength equal to one radius determines a central angle of one radian, or about . In the next example, we compute a change in latitude on the Earth's surface.  The radius of the Earth is about 3960 miles. If you travel 500 miles due north, how many degrees of latitude will you traverse? (Latitude is measured in degrees north or south of the equator.)  We think of the distance 500 miles as an arclength on the surface of the Earth, as shown at right. Substituting and into the arclength formula gives   circle     To convert the angle measure to degrees, we multiply by to get Your latitude has changed by about .  The distance around the face of a large clock from 2 to 3 is five feet. What is the radius of the clock? ft   Unit Circle  unit circle arclength and radians  In the rest of this chapter we will see how to use the trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent when the input variable is measured in radians instead of degrees, and why making that change greatly increases the utility of those functions. In Section 4.1 we connected the sine and cosine to the coordinates of points on a unit circle , a circle of radius 1. Here is an important observation that will inform our study:  On a unit circle, , so the arclength formula becomes . Thus, on a unit circle, an arc of length 1 determines a central angle of 1 radian, or about . And the measure of a (positive) angle in radians is equal to the length of the arc it spans. In other words, if we walk around the circle, each time we travel over an arclength of one radius, we turn through an angle of one radian.  You are walking on a trail around a circular pond of radius one mile. You have have walked 4 miles from the trailhead. Sketch your location now.  The pond is a unit circle, so you have traversed an angle in radians equal to the arc length traveled, 4 miles. An angle of 4 radians is in the middle of the third quadrant relative to your starting point, more than halfway but less than three-quarters around the pond. walk along circle pond    An ant walks around the rim of a circular birdbath of diameter 2 feet.

The dial of Big Ben's clock in London is 23 feet in diameter. How long is the arc traced by the minute hand between 9:05 pm and 9:30 pm?      The largest clock ever constructed was the Floral Clock in the garden of the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. The hour hand was 50 feet long, the minute hand was 75 feet long, and the radius of the clockface was 112 feet.   If you started at the 12 and walked 500 feet clockwise around the clockface, through how many radians would you walk?  If you started your walk at noon, how long would it take the minute hand to reach your position? How far did the tip of the minute hand move in its arc?   In 1851 Jean-Bernard Foucault demonstrated the rotation of the earth with a pendulum installed in the Pantheon in Paris. Foucault's pendulum consisted of a cannonball suspended on a 67 meter wire, and it swept out an arc of 8 meters on each swing. Through what angle did the pendulum swing? Give your answer in radians and then in degrees, rounded to the nearest hundredth.  A wheel with radius 40 centimeters is rolled a distance of 1000 centimeters on a flat surface. Through what angle has the wheel rotated? Give your answer in radians and then in degrees, rounded to one decimal place.  Clothes dryers draw 3.5 times as much power as washing machines, so newer machines have been engineered for greater efficiency. A vigorous spin cycle reduces the time needed for drying, and some front-loading models spin at a rate of 1500 rotations per minute.   If the radius of the drum is 11 inches, how far do your socks travel in one minute?  How fast are your socks traveling during the spin cycle?      The Hubble telescope is in orbit around the earth at an altitude of 600 kilometers, and completes one orbit in 97 minutes.  How far does the telescope travel in one hour? (The radius of the earth is 6400 kilometers.)  What is the speed of the Hubble telescope?   The first large windmill used to generate electricity was built in Cleveland, Ohio in 1888. Its sails were 17 meters in diameter, and moved at 10 rotations per minute. How fast did the ends of the sails travel?  The largest windmill operating today has wings 54 meters in length. To be most efficient, the tips of the wings must travel at 50 meters per second. How fast must the wings rotate?

  "body": " The Circular Functions  Trigonometric Functions of Angles in Radians  Measuring angles in radians has other applications besides calculating arclength, and we will need to evaluate trigonometric functions of angles in radians. The sine, cosine, or tangent of a particular angle is the same whether the angle is measured in radians or in degrees.  In Section 4.1 we saw that the sine and cosine are related to points on a unit circle.  Angles in a Unit Circle  unit circle angles in  unit circle coordinates of point  Let be a point on a unit circle determined by the terminal side of an angle in standard position. Then the coordinates of are given by  This fact follows easily from the definitions of sine and cosine, because on a unit circle . In the next Activity we'll use this relationship to get a feel for the trig values of angles in radians.  Trigonometry in Radians  radian  Here is a unit circle with arclengths labeled, measured counterclockwise from . (Note that the distance around the whole circle is 6.28 units!) In Section 6.1 we learned that on a unit circle, the measure of a positive angle in radians is equal to the length of the arc that it spans.   grid   Use the unit circle to estimate the sine, cosine, and tangent of each angle in radians.      Use the unit circle to estimate two solutions to each equation.    Sketch the angle on the unit circle. Use symmetry to find three more angles with the same sine and cosine, up to sign.         Using a Calculator  Your calculator can give you the trigonometric function values for angles expressed in radians. For example, radians is the same as , because , so However, we don't have to convert radians to degrees in order to evaluate trig ratios. First, change the calculator setting from Degree mode to Radian mode. Then enter and the calculator will return . You can check that this number is a decimal approximation for .  Use your calculator to find the sine and cosine of the following angles in radians. Round your answers to four decimal places.      With the calculator in radian mode, and rounding to four decimal places we find  Your calculator will also give you the values rounded to four places. Note that 3.5 radians is a third-quadrant angle, so the signs of the trig values make sense.   Use your calculator to find the tangents of the following angles in radians. Round your answers to four decimal places.        If two angles are coterminal they have the same trig values, just as they do when measured in degrees. So adding or subtracting a multiple of to any angle results in a new angle in the same standard position and with the same trig values.  Find the sine and cosine of the following angles in radians. Round your answers to four decimal places.      Because  is coterminal with and it has the same sine and cosine as . And radians is equal to , so  Rounded to four places, your calculator will give you the values By adding 6.2832 (that's approximately ) to we see that radians is coterminal with radians, a second-quadrant angle. You can check that radians has (approximately) the same trig values as radians.   Use your calculator to find the tangent of the following angles in radians. Round your answers to four decimal places.       Recall the formula for arclength when the angle is measured in radians: . If we solve for , we see that , a ratio of two lengths. The units of length cancel out, so that radian measure has no units; it is a \"dimensionless\" quantity. In other words, a radian measure is just a real number.  We shall see that this property makes radians especially useful in applications. From now on we shall omit the tag \"radians,\" and you may assume that any angle given without units is in radians.   Sine and Cosine of Real Numbers  sine of a real number  cosine of a real number  We have observed that the measure of an angle in radians is just a real number. This is an important observation, because it allows us to define the sine and cosine as functions of real numbers, instead of as functions of angles.  Sine and Cosine of Real Numbers  sine of a real number  cosine of a real number  We define the trigonometric functions of the real number by where is an angle measured in radians.   We can think of the definition this way: to find the sine or cosine of a real number , we find the sine or cosine of the angle in radians.  To understand the connection between real numbers and radians, you may find it helpful to remember that the measure of a positive angle in radians is equal to the length of the arc it spans on a unit circle.  Consider the unit circle shown at right, and the angle determined by the arc of length . The radian measure of is the same as the length of the arc. (For example, in this figure .)  circle  In practice, there is no difference between finding the sine or cosine of the number 2 and the sine or cosine of an angle of 2 radians: in each case we set the calculator in Radian mode and evaluate   So, in some sense then, a trig function of a radian is the same as a trig function of a real number. This result is so important that it bears repeating: to find the sine or cosine of a real number , we find the sine or cosine of the angle radians. We can now use the trigonometric functions to model periodic behavior as functions of time, or indeed, of any variable.  The sunset time in Stockholm, Sweden, on the th day of the year can be modeled by where is given in hours after noon. Find the sunset time on January 1 (day ) and on July 1 (day ).  Sinusoidal graph of Stockholm's sunset time vs days   Evaluate the function for to find On January 1, sunset in Stockholm occurs about 2.99 hours after noon, or at 2:59 pm.  Evaluate the function at to find On July 1, sunset occurs about 9.11 hours after noon, or at 9:07 pm. (Actually, 10:07 pm, because of daylight savings time.)  Variable stars are important in astronomy because they are used to estimate distances. Their magnitude, or brightness, varies periodically and can be modeled by trigonometric functions. The star T Herculis reached its minimum magnitude on December 27, 2004, and days later its magnitude is approximately  Sinusoidal graph of star brightness   What was the magnitude of T Herculis on December 27, 2004?  What was the magnitude of T Herculis be on December 27, 2006 (730 days later)?       The Tangent Function  tangent function  We can also define the tangent function for real numbers. Let be the terminal point of an arc of length in standard position on a unit circle. Then Of course, this definition agrees with our earlier definition of the tangent function for angles, because the point lies on the terminal side of the angle radians.   For example, we saw earlier that, rounded to four decimal places, so the coordinates of point on the unit circle in the figure at right are . Therefore,  circle  You can set your calculator in radian mode to verify that, to three decimal places,  Because the trig values can be found as coordinates on a unit circle, our three trig functions are often called the circular functions . We now have the following definitions for the circular functions of real numbers.  The Circular Functions  circular function  sine of a real number  cosine of a real number  tangent of a real number  Let be the terminal point of an arc of length in standard position on a unit circle. The circular functions of are defined by    circle    Use the graph of the unit circle shown below to estimate , and .  Unit circle    The circle is scaled in units of 0.1 radians, and an arc of 2.5 radians in standard position has its terminal point, , in the second quadrant. The coordinates of are approximately , so we have To find , we calculate .  Use the graph of the unit circle in the previous example to estimate , and . , ,   The Special Values  special angles radians  In Chapter 2 you learned the exact trig values for the \"special angles\" and . Recall that the trig values for these angles can be used as benchmarks for estimating and mental calculation. Now we review those values when the angles are measured in radians.  The easiest way to remember the special values is to refer to the sides of the two special triangles:   45-45-90 triangle    30-60-90 triangle        Degrees  Radians  Sine  Cosine  Tangent                               undefined   circle  You can use these values to find trig values for the special angles in all four quadrants.  Recall that we use reference angles to define the trigonometric ratios for angles greater than . (See Section 4.1 to review reference angles.) The figure below shows how to calculate reference angles in radians. Note that the formulas are the same as those for degrees if we replace by !  Reference Angles in Radians  angles  Give exact values for the following.       The reference angle for is , and the tangent is negative in the second quadrant. (See the figure at right.) Thus,   angles   The reference angle for is , and the cosine is negative in the third quadrant, so  angles   At this point, you may feel that expressions such as look like hieroglyphics. Keep in mind that and are just numbers, so the equation above says that \"the cosine of an angle of 3.9 radians is about -0.7.\"  Give exact values for the following.

Use similar triangles to show that the coordinates of a point determined by angle on a circle of radius are . (See the figure at right.)   circles    The two right triangles shown are similar, so their sides are proportional. The hypotenuse of the large triangle is times the hypotenuse of the small triangle, so the two legs of the large triangle must be times the legs of the small triangle. Thus, because the coordinates of the vertex on the unit circle are , the coordinates of must be .  The Astrodome in Houston has a diameter of 710 feet. If you start at the easternmost point and walk counterclockwise around its perimeter for a distance of 250 feet, how far north of your starting point are you?

Stonehenge  They form the corners of a rectangle inscribed in the Aubrey Circle on the perimeter of the henge, which has diameter 288 feet. A line from the center of the circle and perpendicular to the long edge of the rectangle points through the Slaughter Stones at the entrance of the henge and out to the Heel Stone. If you stood in the center of the circle on the summer solstice, you would see the sun rise directly over the Heel Stone.  Stonehenge   The sun rises east of north on the summer solstice at Stonehenge. If the positive -axis points north, find the coordinates of the henge entrance relative to its center.

  "body": " Graphs of the Circular Functions  We can graph the circular functions and just as we graphed trigonometric functions of angles in degrees. The only difference is that we scale the horizontal axis in radians.  The Sine and Cosine Functions  Consider the graph shown below.   sine   You can probably recognize this graph as one cycle of . For example, you can see that the graph completes one cycle at radians, or approximately 6.28. It reaches its maximum value, , at , or approximately 1.57. You should also notice that at , approximately 3.14.  Instead of scaling the horizontal axis with integers, we often use multiples of . Using such a scale, we can show the exact location of the intercepts of the graph, and of its high and low points.  Graph one cycle of , and scale the horizontal axis in multiples of .  We start by making a table of values for , where is in radians. We'll use the special values of , because we know the sines of those values.                          In order to plot the points in the table, we scale the horizontal axis in multiples of . (Note that the special values are all multiples of . Thus, , , and so on.) The table lists values of in the first two quadrants; in quadrants three and four the sine values are negative.                          The completed graph is shown below.   sine   If we continued to plot points for values of greater than or less than 0, we would see the periodic behavior of the graph, as it repeats the same shape over each interval of length , just as it does for periods of when the angles are measured in degrees.

Try it for yourself. Use the axes below.                  axes   Graphs of Sine and Cosine   We are going to graph and from their definitions. The unit circle at the left of each grid is marked off in radians. (Each tick mark is radian.) The horizontal -axis of each grid is also marked in radians.   Choose a value of along the horizontal axis of the grid. This value of represents an angle in radians.  Now look at the unit circle and find the point designated by that same angle in radians.  Measure the vertical (signed) distance that gives the -coordinate of point .  At the value of you chose in step 1, lightly draw a vertical line segment the same length as the -coordinate of .

Once again, the only difference between this new graph and our old version of the tangent graph in degrees is that the horizontal axis is scaled in radians.  Graph the tangent function, , where is measured in radians.  We begin by making a table of values for the tangent function. We choose the special values for between and .

Find all solutions of the equation.    The cosine is negative in the second and third quadrants, so we expect to find our answers between and .

We write the solutions as   Find exact values for all the solutions of . ,   Modeling with Circular Functions  Now that we have defined trigonometric functions of real numbers, we can describe periodic phenomena as functions of time (or other variables besides angles).  For example, we began this chapter with a Ferris wheel of radius 100 feet that rotates once every 8 minutes. If you board the Ferris wheel at the bottom, your height is given as a function of time by where is measured in minutes after boarding.   Thus, after minutes your height is and after minutes your height is  sinusoidal graph   The graph of is shown above. From the graph, we see that the midline of the function is , its amplitude is 100, and its period is 8 (which is reasonable because the Ferris wheel rotates every 8 minutes). You can review period, midline, and amplitude of periodic functions in Section 4.3.  The formula gives the number of hours of daylight in Glasgow, Scotland, as a function of time, in months after January 1.   Graph the function on your calculator (make sure the calculator is set in radian mode).  State the midline, amplitude, and period of the graph.  How many hours of daylight does Glasgow enjoy on the longest day of the year?  In which months does Glasgow experience less than 8 hours of light per day?    The graph is shown below.  sinusoidal graph  The midline of the graph is hours, the amplitude is 5.25 hours, and the period is 12 months.  On the longest day of the year, there are hours of daylight in Glasgow.  From the graph, we see that for between 0 and 2, or in January and February. is also less than 8 for a short time between and , at the end of December.

For many familiar functions, the domain is the set of all real numbers. In particular, the domain of any linear or quadratic function is the set of all real numbers.  Consider the functions and shown below. We can use any real number as an input for either of these functions, and their graphs extend across the entire -axis.   three graphs   However, for other types of functions we must sometimes exclude certain values from the domain. For example, the domain of the function is restricted because we cannot take the square root of a negative number. We must have , so the domain of the function consists of all .  You can see the domain of a function in its graph; notice that there are no points on the graph of with -coordinates less than .  The range range of a function is the set of all output values for the function. We can also see the range of a function in its graph; it is the set of all -values for points on the graph.   Because the graph of extends infinitely in both directions, its range consists of all real numbers. There is an input value that will produce any output we want.  However, the range of consists of all , because there are no points on the graph with -coordinate less than .  The range of consists of all .   Domain and Range  The domain domain of a function is the set of all possible input values.  The range range of a function is the set of all output values for the function.   Find the domain and range of each function.       There are no restrictions on the input values for this function, so its domain is all real numbers. The graph is a parabola with high point at , so the range of the function is all . See the figure below left.   parabola  graph of hyperbola   Because we cannot divide by zero, we cannot allow for this function. Thus, the domain of is all real numbers except . The graph has a horizontal asymptote at , and you can see that there is no input that will produce an output of zero. So the range of is all real numbers except .    Use the formula and a graph to find the domain and range.       Dom ( ): all real numbers except , Rge ( ): all real numbers except  Dom ( ): , Rge ( ):    What about the domain and range of the trigonometric functions? The sine and cosine both include all real numbers in their domains; we can find the sine or cosine of any number. Because the output values of the sine and cosine are both defined by the coordinates of points on a unit circle, their values cannot be greater than or less than . The range of both sine and cosine is the interval .  The tangent function is undefined at odd multiples of (that is, at ), so those values must be excluded from its domain. However, the output values of the tangent function increase without bound as the input approaches from the left, and decrease from the right. The range of the tangent is all real numbers.

We measure angles in radians when we work with arclength.  Radians  The radian measure of an angle is given by  An arclength equal to one radius determines a central angle of one radian.  Radian measure can be expressed as multiples of or as decimals.     Degrees                        Quadrantal angles on unit circle radian approximation    We multiply by the appropriate conversion factor to convert between degrees and radians.  Unit Conversion for Angles   To convert from radians to degrees we multiply the radian measure by .  To convert from degrees to radians we multiply the degree measure by .   Arclength Formula  On a circle of radius , the length of an arc spanned by an angle in radians is  On a unit circle , the measure of a (positive) angle in radians is equal to the length of the arc it spans.  The sine, cosine, or tangent of a particular angle is the same whether the angle is measured in radians or in degrees.  You should be familiar with the trig values of the special angles in radians.    Degrees  Radians  Sine  Cosine  Tangent                               undefined   To find the sine or cosine of a real number , we draw an arc of length on a unit circle, and then find the sine or cosine of the angle determined by the arc.  Coordinates on a Unit Circle  The coordinates of the point determined by an arc of length in standard position on a unit circle are circle    The Circular Functions  Let be the terminal point of an arc of length in standard position on a unit circle.

The circular functions (sine and cosine of real numbers) behave the same way.  Period, Midline, and Amplitude  Changes to the amplitude, period, and midline are called transformations transformation of the basic sine and cosine graphs.   Changing the midline shifts the graph vertically.  Changing the amplitude stretches or compresses the graph vertically.  Changing the period stretches or compresses the graph horizontally.   First, we'll consider changes in amplitude.  Compare the graphs of and with the graph of .  Use technology to graph the three functions for . The graphs are shown below.   sines  All three graphs have the same period ( ) and midline ( ), but the graph of has amplitude 2, and the graph of has amplitude 0.5.  The amplitude of is given by , and the same is true of . In the next exercise, remember that the amplitude is always a nonnegative number.  Compare the graphs of and with the graph of . Both graphs have amplitude 3. The graph of is reflected about the -axis.  cosines  Next, we'll consider changes in the period of the graph.  Compare the graphs of and with the graph of .  Use technology to graph and for , as shown below.   cos(x) and cos(2x)  Both graphs have the same amplitude ( ) and midline ( ), but the graph of completes two cycles from to instead of one.

Thus, the graph of is shifted vertically by 2 units relative to the graph of . In particular, the midline of is the line .  Compare the graph of with the graph of .

Amplitude, Period, and Midline of Sinusoidal Functions  amplitude  period  midline   The graph of has amplitude  .  The graph of has period  .  The graph of has midline  .    Graphs of Sinusoidal Functions  sinusoidal function graph  The values of the parameters determine the shape of the graphs of By adjusting the amplitude, period, and midline of the sine or cosine graph, we can sketch these sinusoidal functions.   State the amplitude, period, and midline of .  Sketch by hand a graph of .    The amplitude of the graph is 3, its midline is , and its period is .  One way to make a quick sketch of a sinusoidal graph is to use a table of values. The trick is to choose convenient values for the input variable. In the table below, notice that we choose the quadrantal angles as the input values for the trigonometric function.                                        Now we work backwards from to find the values of , and forwards from to find the values of .                                        Notice from the table that the graph completes one cycle from to , which confirms that the period is . Finally, we plot the points from the table, and use them as \"guidepoints\" to sketch a sinusoidal graph, as shown below.   Graph of y=2+3cos(4t)    State the amplitude, period, and midline of the graph of .  Complete the table and sketch a graph of .                                        grid    Amplitude: 2, period: , midline: .                                        Graph of y=4-2sin(t\/3)    Modeling with Sinusoidal Functions  Sinusoidal functions are used to model a great variety of physical phenomena, including sound and light waves, tides and planetary orbits, and the life cycles of plants and animals. They are also often used to approximate periodic functions that are not exactly sinusoidal, such as blood pressure.  A typical blood pressure for a healthy adult, measured in millimeters of mercury, varies between 70 and 110, and a typical heart rate is 60 beats per minute. Write a sinusoidal function that approximates blood pressure, and sketch its graph.  We would like a function of the form , so we must find the values of the parameters and .  The midline of the graph is , and the amplitude is , so and .  The graph repeats 60 times per minute, so the period is minute, and .  Thus, The graph of the function is shown below.   sinusoidal graph   In the preceding Example , we could have chosen either a sine or a cosine function to model blood pressure; both describe the periodic behavior described. However, if we are given, or would like to specify, the starting point for a sinusoidal function, one choice can be more suitable than the other. Consider the functions graphed below.   sinusoidal graph  sinusoidal graph   sinusoidal graph  sinusoidal graph  All four functions have the same amplitude and period, but they start at different points on the cycle.  The graphs in (a) and (b) start on the midline, so they are best modeled by sine functions.  The graph in (b) starts out decreasing instead of increasing, so the coefficient is negative.  The graph in (c) is modeled by a cosine, because it starts at the maximum point, and the graph in (d) starts at the minimum point, so we choose a negative cosine to model it.   (In , we'll consider sinusoidal functions that start at other positions on the cycle.)

In this section we consider one more transformation, shifting the graph horizontally. The figure below shows four different transformations of the graph of .   translated sine  scaled sine   horizontal compression of sine  horizontal shift of sine  Graph and for .

First notice that we can write the equation as so that , and we expect the graph to be shifted units to the left compared to the graph of .

We'll compare the graphs of the two functions Graph the two functions for , along with , as shown below. Each graph involves a horizontal shift relative to , but the graph of is shifted units to the right, while the graph of is shifted only units to the right. This difference occurs because of the order of the transformations.   sinusoidal graphs  sinusoidal graphs  We transform the graph of into the graph of in two steps:  Step 1: First we replace by to get , which compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of 2. (See figure (a) below.)  Step 2: Then we replace by to get , which shifts the graph units to the right. (See figure (b).)   horizontal compression of sin x  translation of sin 2x    To transform the graph of into the graph of , we perform the two steps in the opposite order:  Step 1: We replace by which shifts the graph units to the right. (See figure (a).)  Step 2: Then we replace by to get which compresses the graph horizontally by a factor of 2, including the horizontal shift. This reduces the horizontal shift from to . (See figure (b.)   horizontal shift of sine  horizontal compression of shifted sine  It is easier to analyze the transformations in the function , because we can read the horizontal shift from the formula. where is the compression factor and is the horizontal shift.  We can write the formula for in the same easy-to-analyze form by factoring the input for the sine function:  In general, if we write the formula for a sinusoidal function in standard form , we can read all the transformations from the constants in the formula.  Standard Form for Sinusoidal Functions  sinusoidal function standard form  The graphs of the functions are transformations of the sine and cosine graphs.   The amplitude is .  The midline is .  The period is .  The horizontal shift is units to the right if is positive, and units to the left if is negative.

First, we write the input for the cosine function in factored form: Comparing the formula for with the standard form, we see that , , and . Thus, the midline is , the amplitude is , the period is , and the horizontal shift is units to the left.  Use a table of values to locate the guidepoints for the graph.

We use horizontal transformations to write formulas for functions that start at other points on the cycle.  Find a formula for the sinusoidal function whose graph is shown below.   sinusoidal function   The midline of the graph is , and its amplitude is . It has the shape of a cosine, but its maximum value occurs at instead of at ; so the graph is shifted units to the right, compared to the graph of .  The graph completes one cycle between and , so its period is . Thus, we use the standard form with , and , giving us as our formula for the function.  In Example 4, our solution is not the only sinusoidal function that fits the given graph. For example, if we regard the graph as a sine function shifted units to the left, we would use the formula . You can check that the two functions have identical graphs. Usually it is a good idea to choose a formula with a small horizontal shift.  Find a formula for the sinusoidal function whose graph is shown at right.  sinusoidal function  Many natural phenomena can be modeled with sinusoidal functions.  Sunspots are dark regions on the Sun first observed by Galileo in 1610. The number of sunspots is not constant, but varies with a period of approximately 11 years, called the solar cycle. Solar activity is directly related to this cycle, and can cause disturbances in the earth's upper atmosphere. Planning for satellite orbits and space missions requires knowledge of solar activity levels years in advance.  The figure below shows sunspot data for the last solar cycle, from July, 1985 through June, 1996, and a sinusoidal function that models the data.  sine   The period of the solar cycle shown is actually 10.8 years. Use this information and the graph to write a formula for the model.  Improve the fit of the model by adjusting its horizontal shift.   The graph has the shape of . It appears to have midline and amplitude , so and To find , we compute Thus, a formula for the model is .  Fitting a curve by eye is a subjective process, but it looks like we can get a better fit by shifting the curve slightly to the left. By trying several values for in , we might settle on , which results in the curve shown below.  sine  The figure below shows the sunspot data for the solar cycle that began in July 1996, and a curve of best fit calculated by NASA. This curve is not sinusoidal, but has a similar shape.  sine   The minimum sunspot number occurred in October 1996. Use the graph to estimate the period, midline, and amplitude of a sinusoidal function that approximates the data.  Write a function that approximates the data.

  "body": " Sum and Difference Formulas   In Chapter 5 we studied identities that relate the three trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent.  Pythagorean and Tangent Identities  trigonometric identity  Pythagorean identity  tangent identity    If we know one of the three trig values for an angle, we can find the other two by using these identities. Identities are useful for changing from one form to another when solving equations, and for finding exact values for trigonometric functions.  Are there identities relating the trig ratios of different angles?  For example, if we know the sine of , can we find the sine of without using a calculator? Or, if we know and , can we calculate ?   The Sum of Angles Identities  trigonometric identity sum of angles  All of the identities that relate the trig ratios of different angles are derived from the sum and difference formulas. Let's see why we need these formulas.  Is it true that are equal for any values of and ? We can test this hypothesis by evaluating both expressions for some specific values of and , say and , as shown below.   3 circles  From the figure, you should be able to see that is in fact smaller than either or , so it cannot be true that is equal to .  Verify that is not equal to .  Use your calculator to evaluate each expression. The two expressions are not equal.  Show that is not equal to . , but  Because the values of the expressions in the previous Example and Exercise are different, it is not true that is equal to for all angles and , or that is equal to .  It turns out that there is a relationship between the trig ratios for and the trig ratios of and , but it is a little more complicated.  Sum of Angles Identities  trigonometric identity sum of angles  sum of angles  sum of angles trigonometric identity  addition formula  subtraction formula  subtraction formula difference of angles      Notice that to find the sine or cosine of we must know (or be able to find) both trig ratios for both and and .  The sum and difference formulas can be used to find exact values for trig ratios of various angles.  Find an exact value for .  We can write as the sum of two special angles: . Now apply the sum of angles identity for cosine. Thus, . You can check that your calculator gives the same decimal approximation of about for both and .   Find an exact value for .  Of course, the sum formulas hold for angles in radians as well as degrees.  Suppose that and . Find an exact value for .  Recall that and . Substituting these values into the sum formula for sine, we find   Suppose that and . Find an exact value for .  Negative Angles  I Using Reference Triangles   Suppose that is a first-quadrant angle. In which quadrant would you find ?  Sketch an example for , , and the reference triangle for each.  How is related to ? What about and ?  Repeat part (1) for the case where is a second-quadrant angle.   II Using Graphs   Look at the graph of , and choose three positive values of . Draw dots on the graph that show their function values.   sine graph  Find the negatives of your three values of from part (a), and draw dots to show their function values.  How do the values of compare to the values of ?  Repeat part (1) for the graph of .   cosine graph  Repeat part (1) for the graph of .   tangent graph   III Negative Angle Identities  State your conclusions from parts I and II as identities:      The Difference of Angles Identities  The difference formulas for sine and cosine can be derived easily from the sum formulas, using the identities for negative angles. Note that the difference formulas are identical to the corresponding sum formulas, except for the signs.  Difference of Angles Identities  trigonometric identity difference of angles  difference of angles  difference of angles trigonometric identity      Use the fact that to evaluate exactly.  Remember that , and . Substituting all these values into the difference formula for cosine, we obtain the following. You can check that your calculator gives the same decimal approximation of about 0.9659 for both and .  Evaluate exactly.   Sum and Difference Identities for Tangent  There are also sum and difference formulas for the tangent.  Sum and Difference Identities for Tangent  trigonometric identity sum and difference for tangent  difference of angles  sum of angles     Find an exact value for .  We observe that , so . We can apply the sum formula for tangent.   Evaluate exactly.   Double Angle Identities  double angle identity  There are a number of other very useful identities that can be derived from the sum and difference formulas. In particular, if we set in the sum of angles identities (also called addition formulas addition formula addition formula sum of angles ), we obtain the double angle formulas double angle formulas double angle formulas double angle identity . These identities are used frequently, so it is helpful to know them well.  Double Angle Identities  trigonometric identity double angle  double angle identity      You can also justify the identities to yourself by graphing both sides of the formula to see that the graphs are identical.  The first thing we can learn from the double angle formulas is that is not equal to ! You can check this very easily by choosing a value for , say . Then and . Similarly, and  Find for the angle shown.  triangle  We start by using the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse of the triangle. so . Thus, and . Now we can use these values in the double angle identity to find .   Find and for the angle shown in the previous example.  We will often work with algebraic expressions instead of numerical values for the trig ratios.  Use the figure to express in terms of .  triangle  We use the Pythagorean Theorem to find an expression for the third side of the triangle. Now we can write expressions for the sine and cosine of . Finally, we substitute these expressions into the double angle identity.   For the triangle in the previous example, find expressions for and .   By using the Pythagorean identity, we can write the double angle formula for cosine in two alternate forms.    Thus, we have three forms for the double angle formula for cosine, and we can use whichever form is most convenient for a particular problem.  Double Angle Identities for Cosine  trigonometric identity double angle  double angle identity for cosine    Find an expression for if you know that .  We use the identity    Find an expression for if you know that .   Solving Equations  If a trigonometric equation involves more than one angle, we use identities to rewrite the equation in terms of a single angle.  Solve for .  We first use the double angle formula to write in terms of trig functions of alone.   Once we have all the trig functions in terms of a single angle, we try to write the equation in terms of a single trig function. In this case, we can factor the left side to separate the trig functions.   There are four solutions, and .  Solve for .  Identities  I Sum of Angles Identities   Is it true that ? Try it for and .   Recall the distributive law, , where the parentheses denote multiplication. Is the same law true when the parentheses denote a function? In other words, is it true that ?  In the expression , do the parentheses denote multiplication or the application of a function? Does the distributive law apply to ? Do you think that is an identity?   Look at the Sum of Angles Identities in this section. Make some observations that will help you memorize these formulas.  Do you think you would have to memorize these formulas if the equation were an identity?  II Difference of Angles Identities, Tangent Identities    Yikes! More formulas. Compare the Difference of Angles Identities with the Sum of Angles Identities. If you have memorized the Sum formulas, how can you also memorize the Difference formulas?  Comment on the sign patterns in the Sum and Difference Identities for Tangent.   Now let's use the formulas backwards: look at the expression below: Does it remind you of the left side of one of the six new identities? Use that identity to simplify the expression.  Do the same thing for this expression:   III Double Angle Identities    Is it true that ? Choose a value for and try it. Sketch and on a unit circle and show the sine of each.  Is it true that ? Repeat part (a) for cosine.   Substitute and into the sum of angles formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent to derive the double angle formulas.  Choose one of the three forms of the Double Angle Identity for Cosine. Use the Pythagorean Identity to convert from that form to each of the other two forms.

Is the same law true when the parentheses denote a function? In other words, is it true that ?  In the expression , do the parentheses denote multiplication or the application of a function? Does the distributive law apply to ? Do you think that is an identity?   Look at the Sum of Angles Identities in this section. Make some observations that will help you memorize these formulas.  Do you think you would have to memorize these formulas if the equation were an identity?  II Difference of Angles Identities, Tangent Identities    Yikes! More formulas. Compare the Difference of Angles Identities with the Sum of Angles Identities. If you have memorized the Sum formulas, how can you also memorize the Difference formulas?  Comment on the sign patterns in the Sum and Difference Identities for Tangent.   Now let's use the formulas backwards: look at the expression below: Does it remind you of the left side of one of the six new identities? Use that identity to simplify the expression.  Do the same thing for this expression:   III Double Angle Identities    Is it true that ? Choose a value for and try it. Sketch and on a unit circle and show the sine of each.  Is it true that ? Repeat part (a) for cosine.   Substitute and into the sum of angles formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent to derive the double angle formulas.  Choose one of the three forms of the Double Angle Identity for Cosine. Use the Pythagorean Identity to convert from that form to each of the other two forms.  "

For example, if we know that , then  In other words, we use the , , and keys to solve trigonometric equations, just as we use square roots to solve quadratic equations. Using one of these keys performs the inverse operation inverse operation inverse operation inverse for computing a sine, cosine or tangent, just as extracting square roots is the inverse of squaring a number.  Many functions can be described as an operation or as a sequence of operations on the input value, and this leads us to the notion of an inverse function.  Inverse of a Function  inverse function  Raising a number to the power and taking roots are an example of inverse operations. For example, if we first cube a number and then take the cube root of the result, we return to the original number.  inverse  We say that the two functions and are inverse functions inverse function . Each of the functions undoes the results of the other function. You can confirm this behavior by consulting the tables of values for the two functions.                                                      Observe that the table of values for can be obtained from the table for by interchanging the values of and in each ordered pair. In fact, we can often find a formula for the inverse function by interchanging the input and output variables in the formula for the function, and then solving for the new output variable.  For our example, we start with the formula for the cubing function: We use the notation to denote the inverse function. Thus, we have just shown that the inverse function for is .  The notation does mean !  For example, if , we have , but , and we know that .  Although it is true that a negative exponent denotes a reciprocal, so that, for instance, , the in is not an exponent; this is an entirely new use for the same symbol.  Let Find a formula for the inverse function.  We interchange the variables in the formula for (that is, in ) to get  Now we solve for in terms of by taking the reciprocal of both sides. so  The formula for the inverse function is .  Let . Find a formula for the inverse function.  In the examples above, note that , and .   The Graph of the Inverse  inverse graph of  If we graph the function and its inverse on the same set of axes, we see that the graphs are related in an interesting way, as shown below.  The graphs are symmetric about the line , which means that if we were to place a mirror along the line each graph would be the reflection of the other.  This symmetry occurs because we interchanged the roles of and when we defined the inverse function.  graph of inverse  Note that, for this example, both graphs pass the vertical line test, so they are both graphs of functions.   Graph the function and its inverse on the same grid, and sketch in the line to illustrate the symmetry.  Find the domain and range of , and the domain and range of .     The graph is shown at right. Note that has a vertical asymptote at , and has a horizontal asymptote at .  graph of inverse  Note that is undefined at , and is undefined at . Thus, the domain of is all real numbers except 3, and the domain of is all real numbers except 0.  We can find the range of each function by examining its graph:  has a horizontal asymptote at , so there is no point on the graph with . Its range is all real numbers except 0.  Similarly, there is no point on the graph of with , so its range is all real numbers except 3.

This should seem reasonable, because we obtain the inverse function by interchanging the values of theinput and output variables.  Domain and Range of Inverse Function  domain of inverse function  range of inverse function  Domain Range Domain Range   Does Every Function Have an Inverse?  In the examples above, the inverse of the function turned out to be a function as well. But this is not always the case. Consider the function . First we'll find a formula for the inverse. We interchange and and solve for :   The graphs of and its inverse are shown at right. You can see that although is a function, its inverse is not.  function and inverse  Is there some way to predict whether the inverse of a function will be a function, too? Yes! In order for the inverse to be a function, its graph must pass the vertical line test. (Recall that if a graph passes the vertical line test, there is only one -value for each value of .)  Now, we obtain the inverse by interchanging and in the formula for a function, so the inverse will be a function only if the original function passes the horizontal line test. A function that passes the horizontal line test is called one-to-one one-to-one .  Horizontal Line Test  horizontal line test  A function passes the Horizontal Line Test if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. In that case, there is only one -value for each -value, and the function is called one-to-one .  It is always the case that we can find the inverse of a function: we just interchange the domain and range values. However, the important question is whether the inverse is also a function. If the inverse is a function, we say that “ has an inverse function inverse function .” All of this leads us to the following result.  Inverse Function  A function has an inverse function if and only if is one-to-one.   Which of the graphs below represent functions?  Which of the functions are one-to-one?  Which of these functions have inverse functions?    three graphs   All three graphs pass the vertical line test, so all three represent functions.  Only the function represented by graph II passes the horizontal line test, so it is the only one-to-one function.  Only function II is one-to-one, so it is the only function that has an inverse function.   Which of the functions below are one-to-one?   three graphs I and III   Restricting the Domain: The Inverse Sine Function  domain restrict  Sometimes it is so important that the inverse be a function that we are willing to sacrifice part of the original function to achieve this result.   Look again at the graph of . If we use only nonnegative -values for the domain, we create a new function, The graph of this new function is shown as a dashed curve in the figure at right.  function and inverse function  The new function is one-to-one, and its inverse, , is also a function. (We could also have used only negative -values for the domain, or some smaller interval, just as long as the resulting function is one-to-one.)  We say that we have restricted the domain domain restrict of the original function, and we will use this technique to define inverse functions for the trigonometric functions.  The sine function is not one-to-one; there are many angles that have the same sine value. In order to define its inverse function, we must restrict the domain of the sine to an interval on which the -values do not repeat. But there are many candidates for such an interval; which one shall we choose?  It turns out that the most useful interval is found by starting at and moving as far as we can in either direction until the -values begin to repeat. By doing so, we obtain the restricted domain , as shown below. This piece of the function includes all of the original range values, from to .   restricted sine  Because the sine function is one-to-one on this domain, its inverse is a function.  The graph of the inverse sine function, , is shown below. Its domain is the same as the range of the sine function, namely , and its range is our restricted domain for sine, .   inverse sine  The inverse sine function  inverse sine  sin  The function is defined as follows:  In other words, is the angle in radians, between and , whose sine is . There are many angles with a given sine value , but only one of these angles can be . This is why the calculator's key only gives outputs between and .  If is positive, the inverse sine function delivers a first quadrant angle, .  If is negative, the inverse sine function delivers a fourth quadrant angle, .   Simplify each expression without using a calculator.      We know that is an angle whose sine is , and that . Because is negative, we must find an angle in the fourth quadrant, and because , the reference angle for is . Thus, the angle we want is , and .  First note that ! We start by simplifying the expression inside parentheses: , so . We want an angle whose sine is 0, and which lies in the interval . This angle is 0, so . (It is also true that , but is not in the interval .)   Simplify each expression without using a calculator.         The Inverse Cosine and Inverse Tangent Functions  The cosine and tangent functions are also periodic, so, just as with the sine function, to define their inverse functions we must restrict their domains to intervals where they are one-to-one. The graph of cosine is shown below.   restricted cosine  Once again the choice of these intervals is arbitrary. If we start at on the cosine graph, we can move in only one direction, either right or left, without encountering repeated -values.  We choose to move in the positive direction, to obtain the interval , as shown above. On this domain, the inverse of cosine is a function. Its graph is shown below.   inverse cosine  The inverse cosine function  inverse cosine  cos  The function is defined as follows:  The range of the inverse cosine function is , so it delivers angles in the first and second quadrants. (Compare to the inverse sine, whose outputs are angles in the first or fourth quadrants.)  Simplify each expression without using a calculator.      The expression represents an angle in the second quadrant whose cosine is . Because , the reference angle for is . The angle in the second quadrant with this reference angle is , so .  Because is positive, the angle is a first quadrant angle whose cosine is the same as . This angle is , so .   Simplify without using a calculator.  Finally, consider the graph of the tangent function. To choose a convenient interval on which the tangent is one-to-one, we start at and move as far as we can in either direction along the -axis. In this way we obtain one cycle of the graph, on the interval , as shown at right.  tan  The range of the tangent on that interval includes all real numbers. Consequently, the domain of the inverse tangent function includes all real numbers, and its range is the interval . The graph of the inverse tangent function is shown below. Its outputs are angles in the first and fourth quadrants.  triangle  The inverse tangent function  inverse tangent  tan  The function is defined as follows:  Simplify each expression without using a calculator.      The expression represents an angle between and whose tangent is . Now, , and , so . Thus, .  Because is in the fourth quadrant, is negative. The angle is also in the fourth quadrant, but it must be between and 0. The angle is coterminal with , so   Simplify without using a calculator.  In the examples above, perhaps you noticed that for any value of in the domain of the inverse sine. In other words, if we find the inverse sine of a number between and , and then take the sine of the resulting angle, we get the original number back again. The same is true for the cosine and tangent, so that and .  However, if we apply the functions in the opposite order, we may not get back the original number. For example, This inequality occurs because the inverse sine function returns just one of the many angles whose sine is , and that angle may not be the angle we started with.  We summarize the content of the Caution above as follows.  Inverse Trigonometric Functions  inverse trigonometric function  inverse trigonometric function inverse cosine inverse trigonometric function inverse sine inverse trigonometric function inverse tangent      However,     Modeling with Inverse Functions  The inverse trig functions are used to model situations in which an angle is described in terms of one of its trigonometric ratios.  The bottom of a 3-meter tall tapestry on a chateau wall is at your eye level. The angle subtended vertically by the tapestry changes as you approach the wall.  Express your distance from the wall, , as a function of .  Express as a function of .   We draw a sketch of the triangle formed by the tapestry and the lines of sight to its bottom and top, as shown at right. From the triangle we see that , so .  triangle  Because , .

(See the figure at right).  triangle       Alternate Notations  The inverse sine function, , is also called the arcsine arcsin arcsin inverse sine function and denoted by arcsin . (This terminology reminds us that the output of the inverse sine function is an angle, or the arc on a unit circle determined by that angle, as shown at right.)  unit circle  Similarly, the inverse cosine function is sometimes denoted by arccos arccos arccos inverse cosine , and the inverse tangent function by arctan arctan arctan inverse tangent . Some computer programs use the notation asin , accos , and atan . acos acos inverse cosine asin asin inverse sine atan atan inverse tangent  Simplify each expression.      Keep in mind that is an angle. We'll call it , so that , and hence . Then substituting for in the original expression gives us  We start inside the parentheses: . So . Now is the angle between and 0 whose sine is , and that angle is . Thus,   Simplify each expression.         Simplifying Expressions  The key to simplifying expressions involving inverse trigonometric functions is to remember that the inverse sine, cosine, or tangent of a number can be treated as an angle. If we assign a name such as or to the inverse trig value, it can often clarify the computations.  Evaluate .  Let represent the angle , so that , and consequently . Then simplifies to , and we know that . If we know one of the trigonometric ratios of an angle, we can find all the others, either by using a diagram or by using identities. In this case we'll use the Pythagorean identity, . We have and solving for gives us . But is a first quadrant angle, so its sine is positive. Thus, .  Evaluate .  We can verify the results of the previous example using a calculator, but the same technique can be applied to simplify similar expressions involving variables.  Simplify , assuming that .

Application to Right Triangles  In Chapter 2 we defined three trigonometric ratios for an acute angle; namely, sine, cosine, and tangent.

Graphs of the Reciprocal Functions  reciprocal function graph  We can obtain graphs of the reciprocal trig functions by plotting points, as we did for the sine, cosine and tangent functions. However, it is more enlightening to construct these graphs as the reciprocals of the three basic functions.  Use the graph of to construct a graph of .  Consider the graph of shown at left below.

Similarly, at and , , so the value of is , and we plot the points and on the graph of .  Finally, we notice that the values of are decreasing toward as increases from to , so the graph of increases toward on the same interval.

There are two alternate versions of the Pythagorean identity which involve the reciprocal trig functions. These identities are useful when we know the value of or and want to find the other trig values.

Sum and Difference of Angles Identities          Double Angle Identities   Using one of the calculator keys , or performs the inverse operation for computing a sine, cosine or tangent.  Two functions are called inverse functions if each \"undoes\" the results of the other function.  If is a function, we can often find a formula for the inverse function by interchanging and in the formula for the function, and then solving for .  The graphs of and are symmetric about the line .  The domain of is the same as the range of , and the range of is the same as the domain of .  Horizontal Line Test  A function passes the Horizontal Line Test if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. In that case, there is only one -value for each -value, and the function is called one-to-one .  A function has an inverse function if and only if is one-to-one.  Definitions of the inverse trig functions       Inverse Trigonometric Functions     However,    The inverse sine function is also called the arcsine function and denoted by . Similarly, the inverse cosine function is sometimes denoted by , and the inverse tangent function by .  When simplifying expressions involving inverse trigonometric functions, it can often clarify the computations if we assign a name such as or to the inverse trig value.  Three More Functions  If is an angle in standard position, and is a point on the terminal side, then we define the following functions.      angles   Reciprocal Trigonometric Ratios  If is one of the acute angles in a right triangle,    triangle   Reciprocal Trigonometric Functions       We can obtain graphs of the secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions as the reciprocals of the three basic functions.  We can solve equations of the form , , and by taking the reciprocal of both sides.  If we know one of the trigonometric ratios for an angle, we can use identities to find any of the others.  Cotangent Identity    Two More Pythagorean Identities   We can often simplify trigonometric expressions by first converting all the trig ratios to sines and cosines.

  "body": " Geometric Form  Introduction  One way to specify a location is to give a direction and a distance from a fixed landmark. For example, we might say that the airport is located 8 miles northeast of the town hall, or that a ship has been sighted 20 miles from the lighthouse in the direction 10° west of north. It's not enough to give just the distance to the object or just the direction; we need both to describe the object's location.  In mathematics, a quantity defined by both a magnitude (such as a distance) and a direction is called a vector vector . A vector used to designate location relative to a fixed landmark, as in the examples above, is called a position vector vector position . Vectors are also used to analyze motion and velocity in two or three dimensions, to study forces such as gravity and electric fields, and to design computer graphics and animation.  We often illustrate a vector by an arrow. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector, and the direction of the vector is indicated by the head of the arrow.  Draw an arrow to represent each vector.  The campsite is 3 miles away, in a direction north of east.  The wind is blowing due west at 50 kilometers per hour.   We draw an arrow making an angle of from east. The length of the arrow is 3 units, representing 3 miles. See figure (a) below.    position vector     velocity vector     We draw an arrow pointing due west, that is, making an angle of from east. The length of the arrow represents the speed of the wind, 50 kilometers per hour. See figure (b) above.   Draw an arrow to represent the velocity of an airplane travelling southeast at a speed of 300 miles per hour.   velocity vector      Notation for Vectors  vector notation  In print, we use boldface characters such as and to represent vectors. When writing by hand, we use an arrow above a variable to indicate that it is a vector, like this: .  It is important to distinguish vector quantities from quantities that have magnitude only, such as length or temperature. These quantities are called scalars scalar . They are the constants and variables you are used to dealing with, which are usually denoted by italic letters such as or .  The length of a vector is called its magnitude magnitude of a vector , and is denoted by  magnitude of a vector .  Note that the magnitude of a vector is a scalar quantity. Thus, denotes a vector, but denotes a scalar.  Two vectors may have the same length, but point in different directions. The figure at right shows two vectors, and , that have the same magnitude but different directions. For this example, , but . Two vectors are equal if and only if they have the same length and the same direction, but they can start at different locations. The fact that we can move vectors from one location to another is a useful property.   vectors     Which of the vectors shown at right are equal?   vectors     Only vectors and are equal. Vectors , , and are all the same length but have different directions. Vectors and also have equal lengths but different directions. Vectors and have the same direction but different lengths.  Sketch a vector that is equal to the vector shown at right, but that starts at the point .   vector      vectors      Scalar Multiplication of Vectors  scalar multiplication  We can multiply a vector by a scalar. The figure below shows the vector and the vector . Multiplying by a positive scalar changes the length of a vector but not its direction.    vectors     Thus, the vector is 3 times as long as the vector . If we multiply a vector by a negative scalar, we alter its length and reverse its direction; that is, we change the direction by . For example, the vector . It is half the length of , and points in the opposite direction.  In general, if is a real number, then represents the vector with magnitude times the magnitude of . It points in the same direction as when and in the opposite direction from when . Real numbers are called scalars because they “scale” vectors in this way, and multiplying a scalar times a vector is called scalar multiplication scalar multiplication .    The figure at right shows the vector and two scalar multiples of .  The vector points in the same direction as , but is only two-thirds as long as the vector . The vector points in the direction opposite to and is or approximately times as long as .   vectors   Note that because has a slope of , so does any nonzero multiple of .   For the vector shown at right, draw the vectors and .   vector      triangle      Addition of Vectors  A displacement vector vector displacement represents the change in position from one point to another.  For example, suppose you leave home and travel 6 miles east and then 8 miles north. These two displacements are represented by the vectors and shown at right. When we follow one displacement vector by a second one, the net displacement is a new vector, , starting at the base of the first vector and ending at the head of the second vector.   vectors     In this example, notice that forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so we can calculate its magnitude and direction. The net displacement gives your current position relative to home: 10 miles in the direction north of east. When we follow one vector by a second vector as described above, we are adding the two vectors. The sum is called the resultant vector vector resultant .  For each pair of vectors, draw the resultant vector .    vectors     We draw a copy of the vector so that its base (or starting point) is placed on the head (or ending point) of , and then we draw vector from the base of to the head of .    vectors     Draw the resultant vector .   vectors      vectors     When the resultant vector forms the third side of a triangle, we can use the laws of sines and cosines to calculate its length and direction.  You are camping in a state park. In the morning, you start off from your campground at point and hike 4 miles southwest to point . After taking a break, you continue hiking, and this time you cover 3 miles in the direction east of north, and arrive at point , as shown at right. What is your position relative to the campground?   vectors     The resultant vector, , forms the side opposite a angle. We use the law of cosines to compute its length. Thus, , so you are 1.348 miles from the campground. To find the direction back to the campground, we use the law of sines to calculate the angle at . The angle labeled in the figure is , so at point you are 1.348 miles from camp in the direction south of west.  Delbert has gone sailing with friends. After leaving the marina, they sail for 5 miles on a bearing of and stop at Gull Island for lunch. (Recall that bearings are measured clockwise from north.) After lunch, they have sailed for 3 miles on a bearing of when they get a phone call to return home. What bearing is the most direct route back to the marina, and how far is it? W of N, 3.58 mi  It doesn't matter which order we choose to add two vectors. As with the ordinary addition of scalars, the addition of vectors is commutative, so that . To see this, first draw and starting at the same point.    vector parallelogram rule     To represent , we place the base of at the head of , and draw the resultant vector as shown at left.  To represent , we place the base of at the head of , and the resultant vector is the same as the vector .  Because the vector sum forms the diagonal of a parallelogram in this picture, the rule for adding vectors is sometimes called the parallelogram rule parallelogram rule .  We summarize the operations on vectors as follows.  Operations on Vectors  vector operations on  vector operations on scale  vector operations on vector; adding  vector scaling  vector adding   We can multiply a vector, , by a scalar, .  If , the magnitude of is times the magnitude of . The direction of is the same as the direction of .  If , the direction of is opposite the direction of .  We can add two vectors and with the parallelogram rule.  Unless and are parallel vectors, it is not true that the length of is just the sum of the lengths of and . Vector addition is a geometric operation; the length of depends on the lengths of and and on the angle between them. Be careful to distinguish between regular addition of scalars, such as , and vector addition, , which requires the parallelogram rule.   Velocity  velocity  Physicists and mathematicians use the word velocity to mean not simply speed but the combination of speed and direction of motion. The interesting thing about velocities is that they add like vectors; if an object's motion consists of two simultaneous components, the resulting displacement is the same as if the motions had occurred one after the other.  For example, imagine a beetle walking across a moving conveyor belt, as shown in figure (a) below. The conveyor belt is moving at a speed of 4 inches per second, and the beetle walks at right angles to the motion of the belt at 2 inches per second. After 1 second, the beetle has traveled from his starting point at to point , distance of , or about 4.47 inches. His actual velocity relative to the ground is 4.47 inches per second at an angle of from the direction of the conveyor belt.    beetle on conveyor belt   Notice that if the two motions were performed in succession instead of simultaneously, as shown in figure (b), the resulting displacement would be the same. In other words, if the beetle had walked across the belt for 1 second before it started moving, and then ridden the belt for 1 second without walking, he would still end up at point .  Thus, velocity is a vector quantity, and we can calculate the result of two simultaneous motions by using the parallelogram rule. We treat the two motions as if they had occurred one after the other, by starting one vector at the endpoint of the other. (Remember we can move a vector from one location to another, as long as we preserve its length and direction.)  A ship travels at 15 miles per hour relative to the water on a bearing of . The water current flows at 6 miles per hour on a bearing of . What is the actual speed and direction of the ship?  We represent the ship's velocity by a vector and the velocity of the water current by vector , as shown in figure (a). The actual motion of the ship is the sum of these two vectors, and we can calculate the sum just as if the two motions had occurred separately, one after the other.  So we will add to by placing the base of at the head of , as shown in figure (b). The resultant vector, , represents the actual motion of the ship.    vectors     We first calculate the angle between the two vectors and . Because , we have , so . Now we can use the law of cosines to find . The ship's speed is mph. Next we use the law of sines to calculate the ship's bearing. The direction of the ship is south of due west, or on bearing .  A plane heads due north at an airspeed of 120 miles per hour. There is a 45 mph wind traveling south of due east. What are the plane’s actual speed and direction relative to the ground? W of N, 3.58 mi  In some situations, instead of calculating a vector sum, we would like to find a vector to produce a particular sum. That is, we know vectors and , and we want to find a vector so that .  Barbara wants to travel west to an island at a speed of 15 miles per hour. However, she must compensate for a current running east of north at a speed of 3 miles per hour. In what direction and at what speed should Barbara head her boat?  We draw a triangle using vectors to represent the desired velocity of Barbara's boat, , and the velocity of the current, , as shown below. We would like to find a vector that represents the speed and heading Barbara should take in order to compensate for the current.  We first use the law of cosines to calculate the length or magnitude of the vector . The angle at is . (Do you see why?). Thus,     vectors     So Barbara should travel at about 17.25 miles per hour.  To find her heading, we use the law of sines to calculate the angle . Barbara should head her boat about south of west, or at a bearing of .  Ahab would like to sail at 20 kilometers per hour due west towards a whale reported at that position. However, a steady ocean current is moving east of north at 8 kilometers per hour. At what speed and heading should Ahab sail? 26.76 kph S of W   Components of a Vector  component  component component vector  We have seen that we can add two vectors to get a third or resultant vector. We can also break down a vector into two or more component vectors. For many applications, it is useful to break a vector into horizontal and vertical components.  For example, the beetle on the conveyor belt moved at 4.47 inches per second in the direction . If we set up coordinate axes as shown at right, the vector representing his velocity is the sum of the beetle's motion in the -direction, , at 4 inches per second, and his motion in the -direction, , at 2 inches per second.   vectors     We can break down any vector into its - and -components, and the sum of those components is equal to the original vector. In other words, .  The horizontal and vertical vectors and are called the vector components component of . If we designate the direction of by an angle measured counter-clockwise from the positive -axis, then the scalar quantities given by  are called simply the components component of the vector .  Note that the components and of a vector are scalars; they are not vectors themselves. They can be either positive or negative (or zero), as shown below.    vectors     A plane flies at 300 miles per hour in the direction north of west. Find the - and -components of its velocity.  We draw a triangle showing the plane's velocity, , as the sum of components in the - and -directions, as shown at right. In this coordinate system, the angle is . Because the components are the legs of a right triangle, we have   vectorrs      The wind is blowing 50 kilometers per hour in a direction south of due west. Find the - and -components of its velocity. kph, kph   Using Components  We can describe a vector completely using either magnitude and direction or components. Many calculations with vectors are simpler when we use components. For example, to add two vectors using components, we don't need the laws of sines and cosines. We resolve each vector into its horizontal and vertical components, add the corresponding components, then compute the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector.  To calculate magnitude and direction from the components, we need only right triangle trigonometry.  After flying for some time, the airplane in the previous example encounters a steady wind blowing at 40 miles per hour from south of west. What are the actual speed and heading of the airplane relative to the ground?  We would like to add the vectors , representing the plane's intended velocity, and , representing the velocity of the wind. We first resolve into its components.   We find the components of the resultant, , by adding the components of and , as shown at right. That is,   velocity vectors       Finally, we compute the magnitude and direction of the resultant. So, the ground speed of the airplane is 272.41 miles per hour.  To find its heading, , we compute Because is a second-quadrant angle, we have The plane flies in the direction , or north of west.  In the previous example, the airplane's heading is not . Remember that there are always two angles with a given tangent. We can refer to a sketch of the vector or to the signs of its components to decide which of those two angles is appropriate.  A plane is flying in a wind blowing 50 kilometers per hour in a direction south of due west. The plane has an airspeed of 200 kph and heading What is the ground speed and actual direction of the plane? groundspeed 182 kph, S of E  Review the following skills you will need for this section.

Brenda wants to fly to an airport that is 103 miles due west in 1 hour.

  "body": " Coordinate Form  vector coordinate form  Introduction  In Section 9.1 we saw how to resolve a vector into horizontal and vertical components. Thus, every vector can be expressed as the sum of a horizontal vector and a vertical vector.  A vector has magnitude 4 and direction , where is measured counter-clockwise from the positive -axis. Express as the sum of a horizontal vector, , and a vertical vector, .   The components of are given by      vectors on coordinate plane     Then , where is a horizontal vector of magnitude 3.50, and is a vertical vector of magnitude 1.94. See the figure above.  A vector has magnitude 2 and direction , where is in standard position. Express as the sum of a horizontal vector, , and a vertical vector, . , where   Unit Vectors  vector unit  It is often useful to describe a vector by giving its horizontal and vertical components, instead of its magnitude and direction. To make the notation easier, we give names to the vectors of length 1 that point in the - and -directions. A vector of magnitude 1 is called a unit vector . We can have unit vectors in any direction, but the unit vector in the -direction is denoted by , and the unit vector in the -direction is called , as shown below.  By taking scalar multiples of and , we can describe any vector that lies in the directions of the coordinate axes. For example, represents the vector of magnitude 4 pointing in the -direction, and represents the vector of magnitude 3 pointing in the -direction. And by adding multiples of and , we can represent any vector we like. The vector is shown at right.   vectors on xy-plane     Because the components of the vector are chosen to align with the coordinate system, we call this the coordinate form of the vector.  Coordinate Form of a Vector  vector coordinate form  The vector is the vector whose horizontal component is and whose vertical component is .  The coordinate form of the vector in the previous example is .  State the coordinate form of the vector shown at right.   vectors on xy-plane     From its base to its tip, the vector extends 4 units in the negative direction and 6 units in the direction. Thus, .  State the coordinate form of the vector shown at right.   vectors      Converting Between Geometric and Coordinate Form  vector geometric vs coordinate form  It is a simple matter to find the magnitude and direction of a vector given in coordinate form. The vector has magnitude and direction . Thus, we can readily convert vectors from geometric form to coordinate form or vice versa.  Comparing the Geometric and Coordinate Forms of a Vector  vector geometric vs coordinate form  Suppose that the vector has magnitude and points in the direction of the angle in standard position. If has the coordinate form , then    Find the geometric form of the vector .  Find the coordinate form of the vector whose magnitude is 5 and whose direction is the angle .   The magnitude of is . The direction satisfies the equation . Because the point lies in the third quadrant, we know that must be a third quadrant angle. Thus, .  The coordinates of the vector are given by so the coordinate form is .  Find the geometric form of the vector . magnitude 10, direction   Scalar Multiples of Vectors in Coordinate Form  Scalar multiplication is easy to compute in coordinate form. This is really a consequence of the fact that the sides of similar triangles are proportional.  The figure at right shows the vectors and . The vector is twice as long as and points in the same direction as . You can see that each component of is twice the corresponding component of , so that .   vectors     Scalar Multiplication in Coordinate Form  scalar multiplication  scalar multiplication vector  If and is a scalar, then  In other words, to find a scalar multiple of a vector in coordinate form, we multiply each component by the scalar.  The vector has coordinate form . Find the coordinate form for the vector .  We multiply each component of by to get .  Find the coordinate form for the vector , where .  If we divide a non-zero vector by its own length, we create a unit vector that points in the same direction as . (Dividing a vector by a scalar is the same as multiplying the vector by .)  Find a unit vector pointing in the same direction as .  We first compute the magnitude of . Next we multiply by the reciprocal of its length. The unit vector in the same direction as is then  By computing its length, you can check that the vector found in the previous Example really is a unit vector. Once we have a unit vector that points in a given direction, we can create a vector of any length in that direction, simply by scaling by the length we desire. For example, the vector of length 10 pointing in the same direction as in the previous example is   Scaling a Vector  scale a vector  scale a vector vector  vector scaling  vector unit  A unit vector in the direction of is given by  A vector of length in the direction of is given by  Find a unit vector and a vector of length 10 pointing in the same direction as . ,   Adding Vectors in Coordinate Form  vector adding  It is also easy to add vectors in coordinate form. The figure below shows the sum of and . Remember that we add two vectors by following the first vector by the second.  The vector sum describes the path But we arrive at the same endpoint by traveling   triangle    The resultant vector has components that are just the sums of the components of the vectors and . To add two vectors in coordinate form, we add the corresponding components.  Sum of Vectors in Coordinate Form  vector adding  If and , then  Kyle flew 15 miles southwest and then 20 miles on a bearing of . What is his current position relative to his starting point?  A sketch of Kyle's journey is shown below. We begin by converting the vector for each leg of his journey into coordinate form.     vectors     Thus, We find the resultant vector, , by adding and . Kyle's position vector is , or about 30.3 miles west and 14.1 miles south of his starting position.  Arianna's yacht heads west of north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour relative to the water. However, the water is moving east of north at 4 kilometers per hour. What is Arianna's velocity relative to land? 22.7 kph due north  The coordinate form is especially efficient if we want to add more than two vectors.  While exploring an abandoned cottage in the woods, you discover an old map showing the location of a buried treasure.  From the cottage, go 10 km in the direction .  From that point, go 12.8 km in the direction .  Finally, go 9.5 km in the direction .  You wonder if the directions will lead you safely to the treasure. You draw vectors to illustrate the path described by the directions, as shown in the figure.  vectors  Instead of following the map directions, you plan to fly by helicopter from the abandoned cottage directly to the treasure, but you will need to know the correct heading and distance to fly. Draw the vector for the net displacement from the cottage to the treasure, and give its length and direction.  The helicopter's flight plan is the vector sum of the three vectors , , and shown in the figure. To find their sum, we resolve each of the three vectors into its components. In coordinate form, the three displacement vectors are The net displacement is given by the resultant vector, . We add the corresponding components of , , and .  The treasure is at the point 10 km east and 14.12 km north of the cottage. To find the flight plan for the helicopter, we compute the magnitude and direction of the vector . Thus, the treasure is 17.3 km from the cottage, in the direction from east. The helicopter's flight path is shown at right.  vectors  From your campsite you hike 1.6 km in the direction , then 0.8 km in the direction , and finally 1.2 km in the direction .  Draw a diagram for your hike, using vectors to represent each of the three segments. Use ae grid in which 1 square represents 0.1 km.  Resolve each vector into components, and determine your location after your hike.    vectors     , , ,   Force  When you push or pull on something, you are exerting a force force on the object. For example, the weight of an object is actually a force, the result of gravity pulling the object towards the earth. A force has magnitude (measured in pounds) and direction, so force is a vector quantity. A force applied to an object causes the object to accelerate in the direction of the force.  When two or more forces act simultaneously on an object, the object moves as if it were acted on by the sum of the individual force vectors. The sum of all the forces acting on an object is called the resultant force resultant force .  Abe and Bart are trying to move a refrigerator by pulling on it with forces of 150 pounds and 120 pounds respectively, as shown in figure (a). What is the resulting force on the refrigerator, and in what direction will it move?   vectors     We write each force in its coordinate form. Next, we add the forces applied by Abe and Bart to find the resultant force, .  The magnitude of the resultant force is and the direction of the force is given by   vectors     The force exerted on the refrigerator is about 234 pounds, and it will move at an angle of from the horizontal segment shown in the figure.  Two tugboats pull on a barge in the river with forces and , measured in thousands of pounds. In what direction will the barge move, and what is the magnitude of the force propelling it? 48.04 thousand lbs  If vectors and have the same magnitude but opposite directions, then has zero magnitude and is called the zero vector zero vector vector zero . A zero displacement vector means that the object started and ended in the same place; a zero velocity vector means that the object is not moving. We denote the zero vector by , so .  The vector that has the same magnitude as but the opposite direction is called the opposite opposite vector vector opposite of and denoted by . Then If the sum of the forces acting on an object is , the forces are said to be in equilibrium equilibrium , and the object will remain stationary.  Recall the refrigerator in the previous example. Carl does not want Abe and Bart to move the refrigerator. How hard must Carl pull so that the refrigerator remains motionless?  The force that Carl applies must equal in magnitude the sum of the forces applied by Abe and Bart, but point in the opposite direction. That is, So Carl must pull with 234.3 pounds in the direction .  Suppose that and that and What is the coordinate form of vector ?  Review the following skills you will need for this section.

  "body": " The Dot Product  Components  component  We have seen that it can be useful to resolve a vector into horizontal and vertical components. We can also break a vector into components that point in other directions.  Imagine the following experiment: Delbert holds a ball at shoulder height and then drops it, so that it falls to the ground. Francine holds a ball at shoulder height on an inclined ramp, then releases it so that it rolls downhill. Which ball will reach the ground first?  Although gravity causes both balls to speed up, the free-falling ball will reach the ground first. The force of gravity pulls straight down, the same direction as the motion of the free-falling ball, but the rolling ball must move at an angle to the pull of gravity, along the surface of the ramp. Only part of the gravitational force accelerates the rolling ball, and the rest of the force is counteracted by the surface of the ramp. What fraction of the gravitational force causes the ball to roll?    ramp     In figure (a), the gravitational force is resolved into the sum of two vectors, , where points down the ramp, and is perpendicular to the ramp. The magnitude of is called the component of in the direction of motion, and is denoted by . This is the portion of the gravitational force that moves the ball. From figure (b), we see that , where is the angle between and .  Component of a Vector  component  vector component  vector component component  The component of a vector in the direction of vector is where is the angle between and .  With a little geometry, you can verify that in this example the angle is the complement of the angle of inclination of the ramp, . (Think of similar triangles.) Now suppose that we increase the angle of inclination. As increases, decreases, increases, and hence increases. This result agrees with our experience: as the ramp gets steeper, the ball rolls faster.  Delbert uses a sheet of plywood as a ramp for his wheelbarrow. The ramp is inclined at an angle of to the horizontal. The plywood can support a maximum weight of 200 pounds. What weight will the ramp support?  The component of the weight perpendicular to the ramp cannot be more than 200 pounds. If the weight of the wheelbarrow is , and is a vector perpendicular to the ramp, as shown below, then the angle between and is , by similar triangles. Thus, the component of in the direction of is     ramp     The ramp can support no more than about 207 pounds.  Delbert pushes a lawn mower whose handle makes a angle with the horizontal. If he applies a force of 30 pounds in the direction of the handle, what is the component of the force in the horizontal direction?   lawn mower    23 pounds   Coordinate Form for Components  component coordinate form  In the examples above, we computed the component of a force in the direction of a vector by knowing the angle between and . If the vectors are given in coordinate form (that is, ), we may not know the angle between them. Can we compute the component of a vector in the direction of , in terms of the coordinates of and ?  Suppose and , as shown below. We will need to compute the cosine of in terms of and .  First verify that   vectors and components     Because , we use the subtraction formula for cosine. And finally,  Now we have a fromula for the component of a vector in the direction of a vector .  Component of a Vector in Coordinate Form  component coordinate form  If and , then the component of in the direction of is given by  Recall that the \"component\" of a vector is a scalar. If a vector is resolved into two component vectors, , its components are the lengths of the vectors and . The vectors and themselves are called the vector components component vector component vector component of .   Compute the component of in the direction of .  Find the vector component of in the direction of .  Find the vector component of perpendicular to .   We use the formula derived above. Remember that the component of in the direction of is a scalar; it is the length of the projection of onto .  We would like to find a vector of length 6 in the direction of , as shown at right. Because , we scale the components of by to get   vectors     Because , where is perpendicular to , we have  Write the vector as the sum of two components, one parallel to and the other perpendicular to .   The Dot Product  dot product  The expression , which we encountered above as part of the formula for , is quite useful and is given a name; it is called the dot product of the vectors and .  It is easy to remember the formula for the dot product if we think of adding the product of the -components and the product of the -components of the two vectors.  Dot Product  dot product  The dot product of two vectors and is the scalar  From the formula above, you can see that the dot product is commutative. That is, You can check that this is true in the following example.  Compute the dot product of and .  We apply the formula above to find  In the examples above, you can see that the dot product of two vectors is a scalar. For this reason, the dot product is also called the scalar product scalar product scalar product dot product dot product .  Compute the dot product of and .  We can now write the formula for using the dot product. We have derived an alternate formula for a component of a vector.  Component of a Vector  component  The component of in the direction of is the scalar  Compute the component of in the direction of .  Using the formula above, we have . We first compute and . Thus,   The length of the projection of in the direction of is units, as shown at right.   vectors on grid     Compute the component of in the direction of .   Geometric Meaning of the Dot Product  dot product geometric form  An even more important relationship, which gives geometric meaning to the dot product, follows from the formula for a component. We now have two ways to compute the component of in the direction of : Equating these two expressions, we find or . This is a geometric formula for the dot product.  Geometric Form for the Dot Product  dot product geometric form  The dot product of two vectors and is the scalar where is the angle between the vectors.  The dot product is a way of multiplying two vectors that depends on the angle between them.  If , so that and point in the same direction, then and is just the product of their lengths, .  If and are perpendicular, then , so . (Two vectors and are said to be orthogonal orthogonal if their dot product is zero.)  If is between and , the dot product multiplies the length of times the component of in the direction of .    vectors     Show that the vectors and are orthogonal.  We compute the dot product of the vectors. Thus, , so and are orthogonal. Because neither or , it must be the case that , so or .   Show that the vectors and are orthogonal.

  "title": "Polar Coordinates",
  "body": " Polar Coordinates   The Cartesian coordinate system is also called the rectangular coordinate system rectangular coordinate system , because it describes a location in the plane as the vertex of a rectangle. To construct a rectangular coordinate system, we begin with two perpendicular axes that intersect at the origin. The - and -coordinates of a point indicate the length and width of a rectangle with one vertex at the origin. The point sits at the opposite vertex of the rectangle, as shown in the figure below.  In Chapter 9 we used vectors to specify a location by giving a distance and a direction. For example, we might say that the airport is located 5 miles southwest of the city center. This method of designating locations is so useful that we will construct a new coordinate system using the same tools: distance and direction.    Cartesian     polar     In the polar coordinate system polar coordinates we start with the origin or pole pole , and a single ray from the pole, called the polar axis polar axis . We describe the location of a point in the plane by measuring the distance, , from to the pole, and the angle, , that makes with the polar axis (measured counterclockwise). The components of the ordered pair are called the polar coordinates of the point .  Polar Coordinates  polar coordinates  polar coordinates  polar coordinates  polar coordinates distance  polar coordinates angle   Greek alphabet  polar coordinates  The polar coordinates of a point in the plane are , where  is the distance from to the pole,  is the angle measured counterclockwise from the polar axis to the ray through from the pole.  In our work with polar coordinates, we will always use radians for the angle . For example, the point is located 2 units from the pole at an angle of radians, and is located 3 units from the pole at an angle of 4 radians. The graphs of and are shown at right.   points in polar coordinates     A piece of graph paper in rectangular coordinates consists of a grid of horizontal and vertical lines. These are the lines and , for evenly spaced values of . Each vertical grid line consists of points that have the same -coordinate, and each horizontal grid line is made up of points that have the same -coordinate. The grid lines are bench marks to help us locate points with specific rectangular coordinates.  A piece of graph paper in polar coordinates consists of a grid of concentric circles and radial lines, as shown below. Each circle consists of points with the same -coordinate; they are all the same distance from the pole. All points with the same -coordinate lie on one of the radial lines. This grid helps us locate points with specific polar coordinates.    rectangular and polar grids      Plotting Points  You are used to thinking in rectangular coordinates: to locate a point, we move so many units left or right, and so many units up or down. When working in polar coordinates, we want to \"think radially:\" how far to move from the pole, and in which direction.  Plot the points whose polar coordinates are given: and .  To plot point , we move 1 unit away from the pole in the direction , as shown at right. To plot point , we move 2 units away from the pole in the direction .   polar points     Note that even though the independent or input variable in polar coordinates is nearly always , it is customary to list the dependent or output variable first: .  Give the polar coordinates of the points and shown at right, with .   polar points    ,  Each point has infinitely many polar coordinates, because we can add multiples of to the value of . For example, the point with polar coordinates also has polar coordinates and .  If we allow negative values of , there are even more ways to write the coordinates of a point. Each angle designates a line through the pole, and each line has both a postive and a negative direction.  On the line at , for instance, the positive direction lies in the first quadrant, so that the point is designated by in the figure at right. To plot the point , we move in the opposite direction from the pole, arriving at point . Note that the point can also be designated by the coordinates .   point on polar grid     Non-Uniqueness of Polar Coordinates  polar coordinates non-uniqueness   Any point with polar coordinates also has coordinates , where is an integer.  The point can also be designated by .  The pole has coordinates , for any value of .  Give polar coordinates with negative -values for the points in the previous exercise.  The point is also or . The point can also be designated by , or .  Give polar coordinates with positive -values and for each point given in polar coordinates.       Regions in the Plane  In Cartesian coordinates, we use equations and inequalities to describe regions in the plane. For example, the shaded region in figure (a) is the graph of . The pair of inequalities describes the region in figure (b). This region is particularly simple, in that its boundaries are portions of the coordinate grid lines and , where is a constant.    regions in the plane     In the polar plane, the coordinate grid lines are circles centered at the pole, with equations , and lines through the pole, with equations .  Sketch the region designated by each set of inequalities.     The region consists of all points between 1 (inclusive) and 3 units from the pole. No restriction is given on , so the region is the annular ring shown in figure (a).    regions in polar coordinates     The region includes all points up to 2 units from the pole, but only between the lines and . These curves bound the pie-shaped wedge (circular sector) shown in figure (b).  Write inequalities to describe each region shown below.    regions       ,   Converting Between Polar and Cartesian Coordinates  polar coordinates converting Cartesian  Using trigonometry, it is easy to convert from polar coordinates to Cartesian, or vice versa. The figure below shows how the two sets of coordinates are related.  If we know the polar coordinates , we can compute the Cartesian coordinates as the legs of a right triangle.     rectangular and polar coordinates     Find the Cartesian coordinates of the point with polar coordinates .  The polar coordinates tell us that and , as shown below.  The -coordinate of the point is and its -coordinate is   point      Thus, the Cartesian coordinates are .  Find the Cartesian coordinates of the point with polar coordinates .  If we know the Cartesian coordinates of a point, we can compute the polar coordinates as follows.  To find the angle , it is not enough to compute ; we must choose the angle in the same quadrant as the given point.  Find the polar coordinates of the point with Cartesian coordinates .  We first compute the value of . Thus, , as shown at right. To find , we compute   There are infinitely many values of that satisfy this equation, but our point lies in the third quadrant, so we take .   polar     You can check that the polar coordinates convert back to Cartesian coordinates .  In the previous Example, the angle is not given by , because the given point lies in the third quadrant. Remember that there are always two angles between and with a given tangent.  Find polar coordinates for the points with Cartesian coordinates . Give decimal approximations rounded to hundredths.  Conversion Equations  conversions equations   To convert from polar coordinates to Cartesian:  To convert from Cartesian coordinates to polar:  where the choice of depends on the quadrant.   Equations in Polar Coordinates  conversions equations  polar coordinates equations  Polar coordinates are useful for studying objects or phenomena that have radial symmetry, such as circles, spheres, and cylinders, or the central forces (those that act equally in all directions), such as gravity and electric charge. The equations describing these objects are often simpler in polar coordinates than they are in Cartesian coordinates.  It is not hard to convert an equation from Cartesian to polar coordinates: we replace each with and each with .  Convert the equation to polar coordinates.  Replacing by by and by , we get If we solve for in terms of , we find Neither of these equations is simpler than the Cartesian version, but that should not surprise us, because the original equation describes a line, and Cartesian coordinates are better suited to rectilinear graphs.  Convert the equation to polar coordinates.  Perhaps you recognize the equation in the previous exercise as a circle. Note also that its polar equation has a simpler form than the familiar Cartesian version.  Converting equations from polar to Cartesian form is not as straightforward as the other direction (and is sometimes impossible). Here are some strategies to try:  Expressions of the form or can be replaced by and , respectively.  can be replaced by .  can be replaced by .   Convert the equation to Cartesian coordinates.  We multiply both sides of the equation by to obtain Now we can replace the left side by and the right side by to obtain This is the equation of a circle. By completing the square in each variable, we can write the equation in standard form, The center of the circle is , and its radius is .  Convert the equation to Cartesian coordinates.  Review the following skills you will need for this section.   Recall the standard form for the equation of a circle of radius centered at : Use completing the square to write each equation in standard form.

  "body": " Polar Graphs  polar graphs  polar coordinates graphing  Graphing in Polar Coordinates  When we plot points in Cartesian coordinates, we start at the origin and move a distance right or left given by the -coordinate of the point, then move up or down according to the -coordinate. When we sketch the graph of an equation or function, we think of drawing the graph from left to right, with the \"height\" of the graph at each -value given by the function, as shown in figure (a).    Cartesian and polar graphs     In polar coordinates, however, the dependent variable, , gives not a height but a distance from the pole in direction , as shown in figure (b). When graphing an equation in polar coordinates, we think of sweeping around the pole in the counterclockwise direction, and at each angle the -value tells us how far the graph is from the pole.  Graph the polar equation .  We make a table of values, choosing the special values for . For each value of , we evaluate .                          First we'll plot the points in the first quadrant. Observe that as increases from to , increases from to . Starting at the pole, we connect the points in order of increasing . Imagine a radial line sweeping around the graph through the first quadrant: as the angle increases, the length of the segment increases, so that its tip traces out the graph shown in figure (a).    polar graphs     Now continue plotting the points in the table as increases from to . In the second quadrant, decreases as increases, as shown in figure (b). The graph we obtain is, in fact, a circle, which we will prove algebraically shortly. However, we have not yet plotted points for between and . Because is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, all the -values for these angles are negative.                          When we plot the points in this table, we see that the original graph is traced out again. For example, the point is the same as the point , the point is the same as the point , and so on, around the circle. Thus, the graph of is a circle, traced twice for .  To prove that the graph in Example 1 is really a circle, we convert the equation to Cartesian form. First, multiply both sides by to obtain Next, replace by and by , to get This equation is quadratic in two variables, so its graph is a conic section. We put the equation in standard form by completing the square in . We have the equation of a circle with center and radius .  Graph the polar equation .   polar graph      Using a Graphing Calculator  You are familiar with the graphs of many equations in Cartesian coordinates, including lines, parabolas and other conic sections, and the graphs of basic functions. You should now become familiar with some standard graphs in polar coordinates. These include circles and roses, cardioids and limaçons, lemniscates, and spirals.  At the end of this section you will find a Catalog of the basic polar graphs and their properties. You can use your calculator, set in Polar mode, to experiment with these graphs.  Graph the Archimedean spiral , for .  After setting the calculator in Polar mode, we enter the equation and enter the window settings   We then press Zoom 5 to set a square window. The graph is shown at right.   polar graph     Studying a table of values can help us understand the shape of the graph.                  As increases, increases also, at a constant rate. We wind our way around the pole, steadily increasing our distance from the pole as we go. We spiral outwards, tracing the graph shown above.  Use a calculator to graph the polar equation . Use the window settings    polar graph spiral     It is important to connect the points on the graph in order of increasing .  Graph the polar equation .  We'll graph the equation in stages in order to see how the graph is traced out. Begin with the window settings Watch as your calculator produces the graph shown in figure (a).    one loop     two loops     three loops     Observe that, as increases from to , first increases, reaching its maximum value of 2 at and then decreases back to 0. You can verify the values in the table below, which shows the points at multiples of . These points create the first loop of the graph.                               Next, change to , and graph again. This time the calculator traces out two loops, as shown in figure (b). For between and , is negative, so the second loop lies in the third and fourth quadrants.                               Finally, change to , and graph again. For between and , the graph traces out a third loop, as shown in figure (c). For between and , the entire graph is traced a second time. The finished graph is a rose with 3 petals of length 2.   Use your calculator to graph the polar equation .  Complete the table of values for the function.                      Sketch the graph by hand on the grid at right.   polar grid      polar graph: three petals      Sketching Familiar Equations  You should also be able to sketch the standard polar graphs by hand. Once you recognize an equation as a particular type of graph, say a rose or a limaçon, you can sketch the graph quickly by finding just a few well-chosen guidepoints. The next example demonstrates a technique for sketching a rose.  Graph the polar equation .  Referring to the Catalog of Polar Graphs, we see that the graph of this equation is a rose , with petal length and four petals, because . If we can locate the tips of the petals, we can use them as guidepoints to sketch the graph.  Now, the points at the tips of the petals have , so we substitute into the equation of the rose to find the values of at those points.  Thus, one of the petal tips is located at . Because the 4 petals are evenly spaced around the pole, the angle between the petals is , and the other petal tips occur at  We plot the tips of the petals as guidepoints, at , , and . Now we can sketch a rose with 4 petals of length 3, as shown at right.   rose     Graph the polar equation .   rose     The limaçons , and , are another family of polar graphs. In particular, the cardioid is a special case of a limaçon with .  Graph the polar equation .  This is the equation for a limaçon, with and . Because , the limaçon will have a dent, like a lima bean, rather than a loop. As guidepoints, we locate the points at the four quadrantal angles.                   We plot the guidepoints and connect them in order with a smooth curve, as shown below. Note that this limaçon involving cosine is symmetric about the -axis; limaçons involving sine are symmetric about the -axis.   limacon     Graph the polar equation .   limacon     You should also be able to identify a polar graph and write its equation.  Give a polar equation for each of the graphs below.    circle     cardioid      The graph is a circle centered at and with radius 2, so we choose the equation , with . Thus, .  The graph is a cardioid with its axis of symmetry on the -axis, and the \"bottom\" of the heart points in the positive direction, so its equation has the form . At , so we can solve for : Thus, and we choose the equation .  Give a polar equation for each of the graphs below.    lemniscate     cardioid        Finding Intersection Points  To find the intersection points of two graphs, we solve the system made up of their equations. If the equations are and , we simply solve the equation . For example, we find the intersection points of and by solving the equation to get  These are the -coordinates of the intersection points, and we can find the -coordinates by substituting these values into either equation.  For we find  For we find Thus, the intersection points are and , as shown at right.   line intersecting parabola     To find the intersection points of the polar graphs and we solve the equation .  Find all intersection points of the graphs of and .  We equate the two expressions for and solve for .  We evaluate either expression for to find the other coordinate of the intersection point.  Thus, two of the intersection points are and , as shown at right. However, you can see in the figure that the graphs also appear to intersect at the pole. To verify that the pole indeed lies on both graphs, we can solve for in each equation when .   cardioids     However, you can see in the figure that the graphs also appear to intersect at the pole. To verify that the pole indeed lies on both graphs, we can solve for in each equation when .  Both points, and , represent the pole. Thus, the graphs intersect at three points: , , and the pole.  As we saw in the previous Example, solving a system of equations and will not always reveal an intersection at the pole, because may be equal to zero for different values of in the two equations. We should always check separately whether the pole is a point on both graphs.  Find all intersection points of the graphs of and . ,  Review the following skills you will need for this section.

  "body": " Complex Numbers  complex number  So far most of your work in mathematics has been done using the set of real numbers . We often represent the real numbers by a number line, because they can be matched up one-for-one with the points on the line. Every real number is either rational or irrational, and can be expressed as a decimal number, although irrational numbers are non-repeating, non-terminating decimals. However, the real numbers are actually a subset of a larger set of numbers called the complex numbers .  You may have first encountered complex numbers as solutions of certain quadratic equations. For example, the graph of has no -intercepts (as shown at right), because the equation has no real-valued solutions.   triangle     Applying the quadratic formula, we find The solutions of the equation are and , but they are not real numbers. Because is not a real number, the equation has no real solutions.  Imaginary Numbers  complex number imaginary number  Although square roots of negative numbers such as are not real numbers, they occur often in mathematics and its applications. Mathematicians began working with square roots of negative numbers in the sixteenth century, in their attempts to solve quadratic and cubic equations. René Descartes gave them the name imaginary numbers , which reflected the mistrust with which mathematicians regarded them at the time. Today, however, such numbers are well understood and used routinely by scientists and engineers.  We begin by defining a new number, called , whose square is .  Imaginary Unit  imaginary unit  We define the imaginary unit, , by  The letter used in this way is not a variable, it is the name of a specific number, and hence is a constant. The square root of any negative number can be written as the product of a real number and . For example, or . Any number that is the product of and a real number is called an imaginary number .  Imaginary Numbers  imaginary number  For any real number ,  Examples of imaginary numbers are and .  Write each radical as an imaginary number.       Write each radical as an imaginary number.      Just as each positive number has two real-valued square roots, every negative number has two imaginary square roots. For example, the two square roots of are and .   Complex Numbers  Consider the quadratic equation Using the quadratic formula to solve the equation, we find If we now replace by , we have The two solutions are and . These are examples of complex numbers .  Complex Numbers  complex number  A complex number can be written in the form where and are real numbers.  Examples of complex numbers are In a complex number , is called the real part real part , and is called the imaginary part imaginary part . All real numbers are also complex numbers (with imaginary part equal to zero). A complex number whose real part equals 0 is called a pure imaginary number pure imaginary number imaginary number .  The real and imaginary parts of a complex number cannot be combined. Thus, two complex numbers and are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.  Equality of Complex Numbers  Two complex numbers and are equal if and only if  The solutions of the equation are . Write these solutions as complex numbers, and simplify.  Because we have , or . The solutions are and .  Use extraction of roots to solve . Write your answers as complex numbers.   Arithmetic of Complex Numbers  We add and subtract complex numbers by combining their real and imaginary parts separately. For example, The algebraic form of this rule can be stated as follows.  Sum and Difference of Complex Numbers  complex number sum of  complex number difference of  The sum of two complex numbers and is Their difference is  Subtract: .  Combine the real and imaginary parts.  Subtract:   Products of Complex Numbers  To find the product of two imaginary numbers, we use the fact that . For example,  To find the product of two complex numbers, we use the distributive law, as if the numbers were binomials.  Multiply .  We multiply each term of the first complex number by each term of the second one. Because , the last term, , can be replaced by , or , to obtain Finally, we combine the real parts and imaginary parts to obtain  Multiply .  In the Homework Probems, you will verify that the following rule holds.  Product of Complex Numbers  complex number product of  The product of two complex numbers and is  One property of real numbers that is not true of complex numbers is . This identity fails when and are both negative. For example, if , we have but so . We can avoid possible errors by writing square roots of negative numbers as imaginary numbers before attempting any calculations.   Quotients of Complex Numbers  complex number quotient of  To find the quotient of two complex numbers, we use the technique of rationalizing the denominator. First consider division by a pure imaginary number.  Divide .  Because is really a radical (remember that ), we multiply the numerator and denominator of the quotient by to obtain To write the quotient in the form , we divide into each term of the numerator. The quotient is .  Divide .  Perhaps you recall that to rationalize a binomial denominator, we multiply by its conjugate. For example, to rationalize the denominator of , we multiply numerator and denominator by . A similar technique works for dividing complex numbers. We first define the conjugate complex conjugate conjugate complex conjugate of a complex number.  Complex Conjugate  complex conjugate   complex conjugate  For any complex number , the number is called the complex conjugate of .  The conjugate of a complex number has several useful properties. In particular, the product of a nonzero complex number and its conjugate is always a positive real number.  To illustrate, we calculate the quotient . We multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, , to obtain The denominator is then a real number, because and the quotient is  Divide .  We multiply numerator and denominator by , the complex conjugate of the denominator.  Write the quotient in the form .  In the Homework Problems you will verify the rule for dividing complex numbers.  Quotient of Complex Numbers  complex number quotient of  The quotient of two complex numbers and is   Graphing Complex Numbers  complex number graphing  complex plane  real axis  imaginary axis  Real numbers can be plotted on a number line, but to graph a complex number we use a plane, called the complex plane . In the complex plane, the real numbers lie on the horizontal or real axis , and pure imaginary numbers lie on the vertical or imaginary axis . To plot a complex number we move units from the origin in the horizontal direction and units in the vertical direction.  Plot the numbers and in the complex plane.  To plot , we move from the origin 2 units to the right and 3 units up. To plot we move from the origin 2 units to the right and 3 units down. The numbers and are plotted in the figure at right.   complex conjugates     Plot and its conjugate in the complex plane.   complex conjugates     You are used to plotting ordered pairs in the Cartesian plane, so that one point represents two real numbers, given by its coordinates. However, in the complex plane one point represents a single complex number , and the coordinates of the point are the real and imaginary parts of . For example, the point in the real plane represents the pair of real numbers and , but the point in the complex plane represents the complex number .  The modulus modulus complex number length complex number length modulus , or length, of a complex number is its distance from the origin in the complex plane. The modulus of a complex number is analogous to the absolute value of a real number, and is denoted by . If , we can use the Pythagorean theorem to compute its modulus.  Modulus of a Complex Number  modulus  The modulus of a complex number is given by  For example, the modulus of is  Plot all points in the complex plane that satisfy the equation .  The points that satisfy all lie at a distance of 4 units from the origin. In other words, they lie on a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin, as shown at right.   circle     Write an equation for the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin in the complex plane.  We can think of the graph of a complex number as the vector (or arrow) that starts at the origin and ends at the point in the complex plane, as shown in figure (a).    complex numbers as vectors     Then the sum of two complex numbers corresponds to the sum of the two vectors representing them. Figure (b) illustrates the sum of two complex numbers, and , by vector addition using the parallelogram law: we form a parallelogram with the vectors and and as adjacent sides. Their sum is the vector that forms the diagonal of the parallelogram, starting at the origin.  Illustrate the sum of and by vector addition.  Draw a vector starting at the origin and ending at the point in the complex plane to represent , and another vector ending at to represent . Now sketch the opposite sides of a parallelogram, and draw the diagonal starting at the origin, as shown at right.   complex numbers as vectors     This vector represents the sum . You can check that the vector ends at the point  To visualize subtraction, we add the opposite of the second vector, because Recall that the opposite of a vector has the same length, but it points in the opposite direction.  Illustrate , for and .   complex numbers as vectors      Zeros of Polynomials  zero of a polynomial  A polynomial with real-number coefficients may or may not have real-valued zeros. For example, the polynomial has no real-valued zeros. But a polynomial always has a zero if we allow complex numbers as inputs. Because we can add, subtract, and multiply any two complex numbers, we can evaluate a polynomial function at a complex number. Thus, we can extend the domain of any polynomial to include all complex numbers.  Evaluate the polynomial for , and simplify.  We substitute , to find Thus, , so is a zero of the polynomial.  If , evaluate .  The zeros of a quadratic polynomial , of course, are the solutions of the quadratic equation and those solutions are given by the quadratic formula, If the discriminant is negative, the two solutions are complex conjugates. For example, the solutions of the equation are or and . Thus, if we know that is one complex solution of a quadratic equation, we know that is the other solution.  We can now write a quadratic polynomial, with real coefficients, having any complex number as one of its zeros. The factored form of the quadratic polynomial with zeros and is Expanding the right side, we find Because and are both real numbers, this polynomial has real-valued coefficients.  Complex Zeros of a Quadratic Polynomial  zero of a polynomial  If , is a complex zero of a quadratic polynomial with real coefficients and lead coefficient 1, then is the other zero, and   Let . Compute and .  Find a quadratic polynomial with one zero being .   The conjugate of is , so and  The polynomial is   Let . Compute and .  Find a quadratic polynomial with one zero being .  ,   One of the most important results in mathematics is the fundamental theorem of algebra , which says that if we allow complex numbers as inputs, then every polynomial of degree has exactly complex number zeros.  Fundamental Theorem of Algebra  fundamental theorem of algebra  Let be a polynomial of degree . Then has exactly complex zeros, counting multiplicities.  A polynomial has a zero \"of multiplicity \" at if occurs times as a factor of the polynomial. For example, the polynomial has a zero of multiplicity 2 at .  As a result, every polynomial of degree can be factored as the product of linear terms.  For example, although the graph of shown at right has no -intercepts, the fundamental theorem tells us that there are four complex solutions to , and that can be factored. You can check that the four solutions to are   quartic     For example, if , then and Because each zero corresponds to a factor of the polynomial, the factored form of is The four solutions to form two complex conjugate pairs, namely and . We see again that, for every polynomial with real coefficients, the nonreal zeros always occur in complex conjugate pairs.  Find a fourth degree polynomial with real coefficients, two of whose zeros are and .  The other two zeros are and . The factored form of the polynomial is We multiply together the factors to find the polynomial. The product of is , and Finally, we multiply these two partial products to find the polynomial we seek,   Find the zeros of the polynomial .  Write the polynomial in factored form.

  "body": " Polar Form for Complex Numbers  polar form  Introduction  In Section 10.3 we represented the sum of two complex numbers graphically as a vector addition. Is there a way to visualize the product or quotient of two complex numbers? One way to explore a new idea is to consider a simple case. What happens to the vector representing a complex number when we multiply the number by ?  Represent and as vectors in the complex plane.  The vectors are shown at right. We see that multiplication by corresponds to rotating the vector around the origin by in the counterclockwise direction.   complex numbers as vectors      Let and calculate and .  Plot and as points on the complex plane.     rotations of complex number     The previous example suggests that multiplication by a complex number results in a rotation. Polar coordinates are well suited to processes that involve rotation, because they use angles to specify location. Thus, we will next represent complex numbers in an alternate polar form.  Polar Form  polar form  The figure below shows the complex number , represented as a vector in the complex plane. The distance from the origin to is and the angle from the real axis to the vector is .  Using right triangle trigonometry, we see that   polar form of complex number     In general, we can write the real and imaginary parts of in terms of and as Thus, the complex number can also be written as .  Find the polar form for .  We compute    The angle is in the first quadrant, so   polar form of complex number     Thus,  Polar Form for a Complex Number  complex number polar form  polar form  argument  modulus  The complex number can be written in the polar form where and is defined by The angle is called the argument of the complex number, and is its length, or modulus .  Find the polar form for .  Of course, we can always recover the Cartesian form of a complex number from its polar form by evaluating the trigonometric functions. We'll check the result of the previous example:   Products and Quotients in Polar Form  The polar form is especially convenient for computing the product or quotient of two complex numbers.  Product in Polar Form  polar form product  If and , then   This formula, which you will prove in the Homework Problems, says that the product of two complex numbers in polar form is the complex number with modulus and argument . Thus, to find the product of two complex numbers, we multiply their lengths and add their arguments.  Find the product of and .  We multiply the moduli, , and add the arguments, . The polar form of the product is thus Note that and are the numbers from the previous Example and Exercise, namely and . You can compute the product in Cartesian form to check that you get the same result, .  The figure at right shows the graphs of and , and their product, . You can see that multiplying by rotates the graph of by the argument of , namely or .   product of complex numbers      Find the polar forms of and .  Compute the product .  ,   The quotient of two complex numbers in polar form is computed in a similar fashion.  Quotient in Polar Form  polar form quotient  If and , then   Find the quotient of and .  We divide the moduli, , and subtract the arguments, .  The polar form of the quotient is thus The figure at right shows the graphs of , and the quotient .   quotient of complex numbers     Compute the quotient for and .   Powers and Roots of Complex Numbers  Because raising to a power is just repeated multiplication, we can also use the polar form to simplify powers of a complex number. For example, if , then We compute by squaring the modulus, , and doubling the argument, , so the polar form is An analogous result holds for all positive integers , and is known as De Moivre's Theorem.  De Moivre's Theorem  DeMoivre's Theorem  If is a complex number in polar form, and is a positive integer, then  Raise to the fourth power.  We use the polar form, , and apply De Moivre's theorem. Then The Cartesian form of is thus , or . You can check that you get this same result if you compute by expanding the power.  Compute , for .  DeMoivre's Theorem also works for fractional values of , so we can compute roots of complex numbers. For example, by applying the theorem with , we see that one of the square roots of is Now, every number,whether real or complex, has two square roots. To find the other root, remember that we can add a multiple of to the argument of , that is, we can also write the polar form of as The second square root of is thus  As an example consider whose polar form is , or by adding to the argument, . The two square roots of are  You can verify that both of these numbers are square roots of , for instance, The graphs of and its two square roots are shown at right.   square roots of complex number     It is not hard to show that every number has three complex cube roots, four complex fourth roots, and so on.  Find three complex cube roots of .  One polar form of is so one of its cube roots is But by adding multiples of to the argument, we can also write the polar form of as  Applying De Moivre's theorem to each of these expressions gives us two more cube roots  The three roots are shown at right. Note that they are evenly spaced around a circle of radius 2. You can check that adding further muliples of to the argument does not generate any new cube roots.   square roots of complex number     Roots of a Complex Number  A complex number in polar form has complex th roots, given by for .

The point can also be designated by .  The pole has coordinates , for any value of .   In the polar plane, the coordinate grid lines are circles centered at the pole, with equations , and lines through the pole, with equations .   Conversion Equations   To convert from polar coordinates to Cartesian:  To convert from Cartesian coordinates to polar:  where the choice of depends on the quadrant.   To convert an equation from Cartesian to polar coordinates, we replace each with and each with with . To convert an equation from polar to Cartesian coordinates, look for expressions of the form , or .  When graphing an equation in polar coordinates, we think of sweeping around the pole in the counterclockwise direction, and at each angle the -value tells us how far the graph is from the pole.  Standard graphs in polar coordinates include circles and roses, cardioids and limaçons, lemniscates, and spirals.  To find the intersection points of the polar graphs and we solve the equation . In addition, we should always check whether the pole is a point on both graphs.  Imaginary Unit  We define the imaginary unit, , by  The square root of a negative number is an imaginary number: if  A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number, .  We can perform the four arithmetic operations on complex numbers. Operations on Complex Numbers        The product of a nonzero complex number and its conjugate is always a positive real number. .  We can graph complex numbers in the complex plane.  We can visualize the sum of two complex numbers by vector addition in the complex plane.  Fundamental Theorem of Algebra  Let be a polynomial of degree . Then has exactly complex zeros.   The nonreal zeros of a polynomial with real coefficients always occur in conjugate pairs.  Multiplying a complex number by rotates its graph by around the origin.  Polar Form for a Complex Number  The complex number can be written in the polar form where and is defined by The angle is called the argument of the complex number, and is its length, or modulus .

  "body": " GNU Free Documentation License   Version 1.3, 3 November 2008  Copyright copyright 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. < >  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.    0. PREAMBLE  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document free in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.  This License is a kind of copyleft , which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The Document , below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as you . You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.  A Modified Version of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\/or translated into another language.  A Secondary Section is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.  The Invariant Sections are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.  The Cover Texts are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.  A Transparent copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not Transparent is called Opaque .  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.  The Title Page means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, Title Page means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.  The publisher means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.  A section Entitled XYZ means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as Acknowledgements , Dedications , Endorsements , or History .) To Preserve the Title of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section Entitled XYZ according to this definition.  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.    2. VERBATIM COPYING  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.    4. MODIFICATIONS  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:  Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.  State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.  Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.  Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.  Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.  Include an unaltered copy of this License.  Preserve the section Entitled History , Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled History in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.  Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the History section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.  For any section Entitled Acknowledgements or Dedications , Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\/or dedications given therein.  Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.  Delete any section Entitled Endorsements . Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.  Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled Endorsements or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.  Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.  You may add a section Entitled Endorsements , provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled History in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled History ; likewise combine any sections Entitled Acknowledgements , and any sections Entitled Dedications . You must delete all sections Entitled Endorsements .    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an aggregate if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.    8. TRANSLATION  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.  If a section in the Document is Entitled Acknowledgements , Dedications , or History , the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.    9. TERMINATION  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See .  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License or any later version applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.    11. RELICENSING  Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site (or MMC Site ) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A Massive Multiauthor Collaboration (or MMC ) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.  CC-BY-SA means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.  Incorporate means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.  An MMC is eligible for relicensing if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.  The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.    "
